 Flexibility to work-from-home;1;;;;;;
 Open door policy;;1;;;;;
 One can directly go to top level management in case of any queries;;;;1;;;
 not many opportunities to grow from a vendor company;;;;;;;1
 people visits the country we can get involved with them more and they are really supportive and helpful;;;;;1;;
Great place to work;;;;;;1;
little work life balance;;1;;;;;
" There is room to advance, but it is very competitive for contract employees who are all fighting for the same 'transistion"" positions";;;;;;;1
My experience in Google was incredible;;;;;;1;
 I found a very diverse and multicultural workplace;;1;;;1;;
 I had the opportunity to work with very talented people, in an amazing culture and environment;;1;;;1;;
,They appreciate new ideas and people are encourage to share it with other teams;;1;;1;1;;
 Although Google is a serious workplace, they also encourage workers to have fun;;1;;;;;
" ""Work hard, play harder""";;1;;;;;
,During my experience in Google, I had to work with huge amounts of data to analyse and develop the most accurate policy models for the Portuguese and Brazilian markets, and search and identify new trends and patterns;;;1;;;;
Awesome place to work at,good culture,great exposure,Integrated;;1;;;;1;
When I work with my Manager I have adopt more things from him;;;;1;;;
 and it helps me lot but my co-workers says your are change like your Manager;;;;;;;
 i don't know its good or bad;;;;;;;
The typical work day is very busy but there are a lot of opportunities to develop your skills;;;1;;;;
productive and fun;;;;;;;
 a typical day at work;;;1;;;;
 what you learned;;;;;;;
Google was a great place to work;;;;;;1;
 your co-worker;;;;;1;;
the hardest part of the job;;;1;;;;
the most enjoyable part of the job;;;1;;;;
I enjoy working at Deloitte i have been learning so many things such as process knowledge, management skills team work, coordination etc;;;1;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job is the process which i do, i enjoy with what i am doing and the hardest part of the job is nothing but handling alone the region which i am handling right now;;;1;;;;
,I enjoy with my co-workers and my clients, i have learned so many things from them;;;;;1;;
 And work from home option is one of the best thing which emplioyees have here;1;;;;;;
A typical day at work was exactly that, it was typical;;;1;;;;
 I had a set amount of instructions to follow and a certain quota I was to meet everyday;;;1;;;;
 The only thing that changed were the books we had to scan and the quality in which we got those books but all in all,;;;1;;;;
,I learned the importance in the quality of your work and the effectiveness of listening attentively;;1;;;;1;
 Google was the best work experience because it taught me the importance of being on-time and how tardiness/absent affected the company as a whole;;1;;;;1;
,Management at Google was always fair and understanding;;;;1;;;
 I wouldn't have work under anyone else;;;;;;1;
 My supervisors were very efficient in the work they had to do and in overseeing that we were up to par;;;;1;;;
,My co-workers at Google were always fun and easy to get along with;;;;;1;;
 Some of which I can now say I have formed personal relationships with;;;;;1;;
,The hardest part of the job was working with very fragile books in which it was either easy to tear, or hard to open;;;1;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of the job was the job in itself;;;1;;;;
 I am a very social person and the job helped me be social without messing with or up my work at hand;;;;;;;
Deloitte is my first Employer, after my post graduation;;;;;;1;
My work experience in Deloitte had been good;;;;;;1;
This is a great place to work and the people make it worth it;;;;;1;1;
 It is hard to get a work life balance if you want to advance or get ahead;;1;;;;;
You get more experience than you would working in easy 9-5 jobs but it comes at the cost of long work hours, working over weekends and even holidays;;1;;;;1;
 ,Pay is not competitive in Finance roles when compared to other companies;1;;;;;;
 But working for here is comparable to going to a prestigious school, once you're done with it you'll have a really big name to back you up;;;;;;1;
,There is a focus on work-life balance but it is all bluff and not real;;1;;;;;
 If you work your 40 hours a week you're seen as lazy and same if you take advantage of working from home;;1;;;;;
 The culture is work extended hours regardless if there isn't any work to get through;;1;;;;;
,Work politics are a big part of this firm, network yourself well and you'll move up quickly and you'll have a good time working;;;;1;;;
 But do the opposite and you'll hate what you do;;;;;;1;
A typical day at work would be receiving stock deposits and withdrawals on a daily basis;;;1;;;;
 I have learned various things that I have never experienced before like working in a banking firm, how to use SWIFT and other financial day to day procedures;;;1;;;;
 Very supportive management and co-workers;;;;1;1;;
 The hardest part was not getting anything wrong and the most enjoyable was the challenge and accomplishing everyday as it came;;;;;;1;
Wonderful people here;;;;;;1;
 The core product (AdWords) sells itself, so you are mainly an executor and a communicator, which makes the job much easier;;;1;;;;
I am no longer an employee due to downsizing;;;;;;;
 I worked there for almost 25 years;;;1;;;;
 I was a part of a virtual team in the Business Support Center in the midwest region;;;1;;;;
 We supported local, regional and national customers on a daily basis creating, editing and finalizing financial statements for government filing and daily customer deadlines using Microsoft office 2007;;;1;;;;
 I was also responsible for local print production work and customer intake for the Milwaukee office;;;1;;;;
 I was the face of the support center for Milwaukee;;;1;;;;
This company really lives up to its values and has a great culture;;1;;;;1;
 I really enjoy working here;;;;;;1;
EY is a great company to work for and has many opportunities to move upward based on personal goals;;;;;;1;
Execute Consulting services for clients within the risk management practice;;;1;;;;
Deloitte participates in community services, raising donation in house, etc;;;1;;;;
 It is mandatory for employees to participated in pro-bono work for a day of the year;;;1;;;;
 This is what I like most about Deloitte, it gives back to the community;;;;;;1;
Bank accounts reconciliation;;;1;;;;
 Daily forecast;;;1;;;;
 Payments (salaries, national and international vendors, taxes;;;1;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of my job was team working;;;;;1;;
It was a good experience to work with Accenture;;;;;;1;
 I have gained a lot of technical and business knowledge during my 4 years of experience;;;;;;1;
 Work environment is very friendly and productive;;1;;;;;
Working on the AXA Sales Desk gave me great learning experience in being involved with every step of the sales process;;;1;;;;
 Learning about the competitive products through rigorous training, presenting on a large stage to clients and end users of the products, and dealing with the back office to track new business were all highlights of what enhanced the development of my experience at AXA;;;1;;;;
A typical night for me (since i work the night shift, 6pm to 6:30am) is I clock into work, and as a group, the day shift gives report of urgent cases that needs continued attention, the night shift then splits up those urgent cases and we begin to work those cases along with other cases that are loaded into 3 different servers;;;1;;;;
 The details as to what is involved in working cases i can discuss in person;;;1;;;;
,Regards,,Marlon D;;;;;;;

 Though the work was tedious, the environment enabled us to work smoothly;;1;;;;;
 In the autocoding team, the work mainly involved development of autocoding tool to perform autocoding of the given specification;;;1;;;;
 The environment was very conducive and taught me how to be proactive in a competitive field;;;;;;1;
A typical day consists of picking up various packages from different stores and delivering those packages to the customers doorstep in a n certain time period;;;1;;;;
  I've learned how to use my time wisely and to maneuver around the city in a timely manner;;;1;;;;
  Management was okay;;;;1;;;
 It was a bit unorganized and all over the place but they managed to get the job done;;1;;;;;
  My co-workers were good but most not trained properly so it effected work efficiency;;;;;1;;
  The hardest part of the job was delivering packages because of the lack of efficiency in providing proper notification on gaining access to the building and lack of response time from our dispatchers;;;1;;;;
 The pay was okay but not worth the everyday hassle;1;;;;;;
I never really got too much into the MS culture;;1;;;;;
 Because it was only a few weeks after we were purchased that the new CEO announced we were all fired;;;;1;;;
 Bad karma;;;;;;;
The team I worked with is full of politics;;;;;1;;
 The work seems to be over pouring and you don't to develop skills in a particular technology as you are required to keep switching based on the project you get;;;1;;;;
Accenture is a great place to learn and grow;;;;;;1;
 The work is challenging and dynamic and the people are at the top of their game;;;;;;1;
 With hard work and time, it is a place where a career can blossom;;;;;;;1
Microsoft being one of the world biggest technology company and absolutely a mother of the most used window i learned a lot and am willing to share a lot;;;;;;1;

 Being a fresher i have learned a lot in 2 years;;;;;;1;
 Working environment is excellent;;1;;;;;
 Managers are good and supportive;;;;1;;;
 Work pressure is high but very friendly atmosphere;;1;;;;;
 Good place for women employees;;1;;;;;
Microsoft is a huge company and carries with it some of the corporate negatives;;;;;;1;
 However, it has great people and a lot of opportunities;;;;;;1;
,I worked mostly with Great Plains Software employees so I got a mix of both cultures;;1;;;;;

Good company for freshers;;;;;;1;
 Lot of small projects;;;1;;;;

 Good salary hikes;1;;;;;;
 management need to think of expanding business;;;;1;;;
I mostly worked on my own as this is a summer scholar program;;;1;;;;
 I didn't get to meet my colleagues as they live in France;;;;;1;;
 But, it was a good collaborative effort;;;;;1;;
Got good amount of experience and exposure;;;;;;1;
 However, long working hours and 24*7 work leads to imbalance of personal and professional life;;1;;;;;
 However, enjoyed working even in such situation;;;;;;1;
As above;;;;;;;
,A truly global network offering potential to develop projects together with colleagues based in overseas offices and to experience work in different countries or divisions;;1;;;1;1;
 Truly committed to training and improving the skills of employees;;1;;;;;
 A very solid company for those aspiring a long term career and a good learning curve for those initiating their professional life;;;;;;;1
A typical day at work included monitoring mail box, working on multiple reports, processing tax organizer, drafting tax documents to clients, reviewing mail work;;;1;;;;
,I learned a lot about tax preparation with regards to different countries as i supported multiple countries, i also learned about different tools used for tax preparation for different countries;;;1;;;;
,Management was amazing, including my co-workers cos even though i was a part of one team, during requirement i was flexible to support different teams, biggest challenge was to learn the new process from different team, but i enjoyed coordinating with new people and learned a lot in terms of process and knowledge;;;1;1;1;;
Overall Satisfied with the company and its work culture;;1;;;;1;
 Loved to work here;;;;;;1;
,Learnt real time deployment of an application to production server from scratch;;;1;;;;
,Management is very supportive here;;;;1;;;
,The hardest part of the job was the deadline;;;1;;;;

Deloitte is a great place to start and advance your career;;;;;;1;
 The PTO they offer is some of the best available;1;;;;;;
 They also a lot of opportunities in other service areas;;;;;;;1
Its pleasure to work with accentuate its great experience workplace and team work and security of the employee;;;;;1;;
  and improve technology they are providing trainings for new technology;;;;;;;
It was a job, that is really all it was;;;;;;1;
 Low pay, next to no benefits;1;;;;;;
Iâ€™m currently a business intelligent consultant specialised in Business Object (from version 5 to XIR3);;;1;;;;
 My 5 years of experience in consulting have allowed me to acquire a strong technical knowledge with Business Object Tools, from loading data process to reporting, including BO authorization management;;;1;;;;
 I worked for 4 years as a project owner and 1;;;1;;;;
5 years as a project contributor, participating in various projects, gaining an awareness of the qualities necessary to lead a project, such as rigor, a sense of organization, being able to prioritize and making a balanced analysis of a situation;;;1;;;;
Deloitte provides great work culture;;1;;;;1;
,Work-Life balance;;1;;;;;
,Good opportunities;;;;;;;1
Good place to work;;;;;;1;
  More of a relaxed culture being a French company;;1;;;;;
 More training facilities would be beneficial and flexibility to move around the company;1;;;;;;
- Great work-life balance,- Challenging roles and great learning opportunities makes it more intresting,- Nice work culture;;1;;;;;
Microsoft is kind of Ok place to work;;;;;;1;
 Usually its long hours;;;1;;;;
 fast paced environment;;1;;;;;
 Good thing is you have to face lots of challenges with huge curve of learning everyday;;1;;;;;
Accenture is one of the big platform to start with the career;;;;;;1;
 The work culture is very cool and  use to have lot of party and fun;;1;;;;;
 I have learnt lot of things and it will go long way to motivate me to keep doing good work;;;1;;;;
the company is geberous when it comes to compensation and benefits, and reflects it's values and any aspect;1;;;;;;
 I grew mature and resilient in this company;;;1;;;;
I majorly work in bond analysis team and preparation of US tax forms;;;1;;;;
 The process is not properly organised and the attrition rate is bit high and this is due to work pressure;;;1;;;;
 The hardest part of the job is staying late nights in office and working more than 12 hours and the organisation does not provide any incentives for these and they expect to work on weekends too;;;;;;;
At Accenture, I learned to deal with people from various parts of the world and various backgrounds;;;1;;;;
Great people, outstanding company, great leadership, great culture and environment;;;;1;1;1;
 Great work life balance, great benefits and easy commute;1;1;;;;;
Most of the jobs and work at Microsoft are very rewarding with great people to learn from and opportunities for advancement;;;;;;;1
,The company is huge, so there are many roles a person could perform, and changing roles periodically is actually encouraged;;;;;;;
,However, even with the new management in place, the review model is not good and promotes competition over cooperation;;;;1;1;;
 For some people that is preferred, but it detracts from creating a healthy team and company culture;;1;;;;;
,Ultimately, everyone is a number, and the size of the corporation can undermine the value of people;;1;;;;;
 Some teams are better than others and the quality of the team managers makes all the difference;;;;;1;;
Worked on E books;;;1;;;;
 Coming to my is its very and easy task i handled;;;1;;;;
 Its a good management with co-workers;;;;1;;;
 In every six month company use to take one day vacation;1;;;;;;
 resorts;;;;;;;
 funny and enjoyable life,;;1;;;;;
One of the best companies I have worked for;;;;;;1;
 Started my HR career with them;;;;;;;
 I have got immense amount of exposure with them and with this exposure, I am sure I will be able to settle in any organization;;;1;;;;
High levels of personal development, work with excellent people;;;;;1;;
 Early responsibility and rapid career progression;;;;;;;1
It has been a great firm to work for as far as gaining experience goes;;;;;;1;1
the princes trust training programme was brilliant;;;;;;;
 it helped me get a job staying on at EDF energy and it helps to build skills and knowledge as well as confidence;;;1;;;;
The workers are mostly in their twenties or thirties;;;;;1;;
 The environment is laid back, but it's still very serious and productive at the same time;;1;;;;;
At Deloitte the people at the lower levels are personable, smart, and driven, but priorities within Deloitte are what they are;;1;;;;;
 For advancement it is expected that you attend social functions and engage in office initiatives which deliver little to now professional development;;;;;;;1
 Alignment of skills to projects is also lacking and though you are sold billed as being able to do whatever you want the staffing process is highly dependent upon the partners in your office;;;;;;;1
 This is an issue for individuals in smaller offices whose partners largely gravitate towards 1 to 2 practice areas;;;;1;;;1
I was able to learn many new things at work;;;1;;;;
 Management encouraged me to do more trainings to develop myself;;;;1;;;
 My co-workers were encouraging;;;;;1;;
 I thoroughly liked my work environment;;1;;;;;
Work in various clients across the United States;;;1;;;;
 Hours are dependent on the client and roles and responsibilities differ from project to project;;;;;;;
 As a consultant, there is very little work/life balance, however;;1;;;;;
 Good opportunity to travel and work locally;;;;;;;
Its Big 4 company;;;;;;1;
 we were into preparation of US corporate tax returns,I learnt Corp tax, One source softwares,Every engagement is a new one,week ends;;;;;;;
its very good company for work & financial growth;;;;;;1;
 company are arranging training for its employees;1;;;;;;
 too much for learn having European culture;;;;;;;
Overall I have practically all positive things to say about working Microsoft;;;;;;1;
 Like any company, your happiness is greatly affected by your specific team's policies and people;;;;;1;;
 I'd say the majority of people I worked with were happy and were great people;;;;;1;;
Excellent company;;;;;;1;
,Good training and experience;;;;;;;
,Access to resources are abundant;;;;;;;
With a bouquet of administrative things handled my previous one gave me immense pleasure in organising programs self handedly;;;;;;;
,Arranged for free health camps to check 700 employees BP, Diabetes, Blood count;;;;;;;
 Took up many measure weekly to ensure they think about their health and reduce their stress;;;;;;;
,I was in charge of arranging free bus transport to pick up employees from home to work, this area was 10 kms distance from office to residences of employees;;;;;;;
 Employees concentrated staying in the city and hence this plan was successful and appreciated by everyone;;;;;;;
 Dubai summer which crosses 50 deg celcius, smaller bus shuttled from parking area to office, a radius of 5 kms once every hour;;;;;;;
 Even the higher management would use the bus to avoid walking in the scortching Dubai heat;;;;;;;
,Hardest part of the job was to reconcile the medical insurance plan for all employees;;;;;;;
 I had spotted 17 cases that were reduntant and premium for those were being paid even after the employees resigned a year back;;;;;;;
,Management gave us opportunity to manage drivers, I chaired the committee to hear their complaints and bring out solutions for their better professional career;;;;;;;
 Organised a sponsored body check up for drivers to ensure they are not suffering any disease to ensure they are capable of driving the top management bosses for long distances every day for meetings;;;;;;;
 Also encouraged them to participate in jobs out of their profile like helping around in a conference with distribution of pamplets, helping reception in delivering couriers, collection of cheques and cash from banks;;;;;;;
,I enjoyed to organise;;;;;;;
"As the slogan for EY is "" A building a better working world"" ";;;;;;;
 I have grown immensely professionally and individual at EY;;;;;;;
,Team work is crucial at EY ;;;;;;;
I have enjoyed the most part of it ;;;;;;;
A very great place to work with;;;;;;;
 The working environment brought employee to a creative mind set;;;;;;;
 Feel fresh each and very day;;;;;;;
 I enjoyed working there;;;;;;;
Ernst and Young in Glasgow is a fun to place to work;;;;;;;
 Everyday is diffent and the colleagues I have met and worked with over the years have became very close friends;;;;;;;
Great company to work for with like minded people;;;;;;;
 Great benefits;;;;;;;
Although sounds easy but networking is not an easy thing in this company;;;;;;;
 Once joined you are hanging around and at the mercy of talent manager;;;;;;;
,If you are worried about job security, don't join this company;;;;;;;
Allows me to analyse a range of Financial Services products being offered in the industry;;;;;;;
 I have to assess the quality given the industry standards and best practices laid down by the regulatory bodies;;;;;;;
Logistics and create new ideas for Google shopping customers;;;;;;;

 They provide great benefit and training as well;;;;;;;
Deloitte India is an awesome place to work;;;;;;;
" The strongest and biggest thing ever is the ""people""";;;;;;;
 This was my first and most memorable job ever!;;;;;;;
A must have on your resume if you want any type of accounting experience;;;;;;;
 Be ready to work long hours and be pushed to your limit;;;;;;;
 All of your skills will be tested (i;;;;;;;
e communication, leadership, excel etc;;;;;;;
) A work life balance is preached but it all depends on the team you are placed on;;;;;;;
 Must be a self starter and put all things aside for the client;;;;;;;
 Be ready to work 7 days a week and don't plan to do much beyond work till you make senior;;;;;;;
 The job is worth it, the longer you stay in the better the opportunity for when you leave;;;;;;;
 You are groomed for success but you really have to work for it;;;;;;;
It is one of the best companies to work with;;;;;;;
 The people here are cooperative, understanding and able to maintain their work-life balance;;;;;;;
Very Powerful and Enhancing for IT Professionals,Good EXPOSURE to newer lot, lot of documentation to learn;;;;;;;
,Loved working with accenture but don't approve of TALENT EXPERT who judge and are rude sometimes;;;;;;;
 ,Other wise, it's a wonderful company;;;;;;;
Working at Accenture gives an employee an enhanced productivity and learning experiences at the work place;;;;;;;
 Career wise, personal growth are developed with its various training and work enhancement programs;;;;;;;
 Health benefits are given priority and the physical well-being of all employees;;;;;;;
Best place tok work;;;;;;;

Great place to work, many opportunities to learn new skills;;;;;;;
 Performance is rewarded;;;;;;;
,Co-workers were helpful and willing to pitch in to improve the work and resolve issues;;;;;;;
This review pertained the interview process;;;;;;;
,i drove 4 hours round trip to out of town interview;;;;;;;
 Meals expenses were deducted from my reimbursement;;;;;;;
 The form clearly stated that meal will be expense if it has not been paid by the company;;;;;;;
There is too much confusion in the organization;;;;;;;
 It has become huge and no body knows whose who;;;;;;;
 Though they say its a global company but people are forced to switch cities;;;;;;;
 Work life balance is good as far as my assignment is concerned ;;;;;;;
 The work is mundane and everything is controlled from onshore;;;;;;;
Great brand to work with and exposure to the work culture of Big4 world;;;;;;;
Manage the day-to-day business activity and coordinate with my project team daily activities;;;;;;;
,Bi-weekly meeting to overview time schedule and engineering activities;;;;;;;
,Project reviews with top management on monthly basis;;;;;;;
,Site progress;;;;;;;
,Customer reporting and business meetings with client ans suppliers;;;;;;;
Sometimes overload of work, but an excellent place to learn;;;;;;;
If you are mid- to senior- career this is not the place to go;;;;;;;
 Place is run by blow hard Managing Directors who are incapable of speaking without jargon and buzzwords;;;;;;;
 A religious zealotry aimed at PowerPoint decks;;;;;;;
 Decisions roll down hill and anyone who questions them is deemed a bad apple;;;;;;;
 I was a Manager and was basically treated like garbage by Sr;;;;;;;
 Managers and Managing Directors;;;;;;;
 Was actually told not to ask questions to a certain MD because he didn't like not having answers directly at his finger tips;;;;;;;
 Only good for people who have worked here their entire lives or are fresh out of college and want to cut their teeth in a Big 4 environment;;;;;;;
 Warning if you are out of college you will be the PowerPoint/Excel stooge for the team;;;;;;;
People and culture make Deloitte a great place to work;;;;;;;
The culture is about inclusion, collaboration, high performance, and opportunity;;;;;;;
Great atmosphere for fresher for learning new things constantly at work;;;;;;;
Deloitte LLP , India is one of the big four company in financial service providers;;;;;;;
A lot of lifting and cleaning, Washing up and sometimes shopping for food, or cleaning stock;;;;;;;
Reimbursed auditors in Deloitte, China,Reviewed financial problems of departing staff,Communicated with Local Taxation Bureau;;;;;;;
Working for Microsoft was a great opportunity! My job was mostly from Home so I got to virtually meet new people from other countries and coordinate classes for Latin America Sales and Marketing teams;;;;;;;
 I loved it!;;;;;;;
The work culture is very good, enjoyed a lot with the team;;;;;;;
 Very good management, we can balance our work life and personal life;;;;;;;
Overall a good option for employment within the Canadian software space,Good training opportunities,aggressive growth targets,Perception challenges in the marketplace;;;;;;;
If you are smart, you should look for a new job outside of the firm the moment you join in;;;;;;;
good place to work, good work life balance, flexible work options and good pay;;;;;;;
 work is recognized;;;;;;;
 fun at work, team outings;;;;;;;
 Overall, a  great place to work;;;;;;;
My typical day starts with a call with the onsite team early in the morning and over the call we plan our work, discuss the timelines, clear doubts, share knowledge etc;;;;;;;
 Deloitte gives ample opportunities and flexibility to choose our career path and develop our-self;;;;;;;
,Management is very transparent,helpful and takes good care of the employees;;;;;;;
 Everyone is provided with a good medical care program, we also have sabbatical programme, then female employees are provided long maternity leaves and extra allowances ;;;;;;;
,Deloitte believes in diversity and here we can find workers from various communities and background;;;;;;;
 But here in office even though we have cultural ,language and other differences, we are all united by the business, the project and most importantly by the common goal that we all share;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the Job would be working with the team at onsite i;;;;;;;
 Because of the timezone differences we have to attend calls early in the morning and late at night too and this sometimes affects our work life balance;;;;;;;
 Another challenge is to understand the clients need;;;;;;;
 The offshore hardly interacts with the client and all the information and updates come from the onsite team and therefore some information are misinterpreted, some misunderstood and some missed out on its way to us;;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part is the 30 days paid holiday that employees are given each year and plus 10 days public holiday in a year;;;;;;;
,We also have enough of events and programs to keep the spirits high on the floor;;;;;;;
Though I do a lot of the same tasks in the exact same building as before, working for Hilton now through Accenture has brought a bit of change to the 'days of old';;;;;;;
 Accenture is a great company to work for, and brings flexibility and employee oriented events to help bring motivation and boost overall morale while promoting teamwork!;;;;;;;
Awesome straight out of college, projects are challenging, clients are too, but the pay and benefits are fantastic;;;;;;;
 Travel requirements can be brutal and not great for having a relationship or family;;;;;;;
Code of Conduct not adhered to , HR does not investigate just victimizes the victim;;;;;;;
 Whenever they build a new building they mass downsize workers from the old building;;;;;;;
 You only get a month salary when you are fired nothing more;;;;;;;
 They hold on to your 401K hostage for an additional 45 days before they release it;;;;;;;
 It was 5 years of unprofessional work environment worse job I ever had;;;;;;;
That era had very different business and technology landscape;;;;;;;
 Motorola was typically a hardware company, without the necessary internet driven dynamics and enablers to compete in the technology space;;;;;;;
enjoy being there receptionist and up stairs I would file records away  and then I would go back to receptionist desk and love this job because we have free food every time it was somebody birthday  and free bagel and I love that every Friday morning and it was great;;;;;;;

long hours, tough bosses, great coworkers, culture depends largely on project;;;;;;;
 can be difficult to find projects, inefficient method of matching open roles to employees;;;;;;;
Microsoft is a great company with tons of folks highly passionate about their area, technology, pushing the envelop, etc;;;;;;;

As Ernst and Young was my first company, it will always hold a special place for me;;;;;;;
 Everything that I have learnt about corporate life comes from the time spent in EY;;;;;;;
 A fantastic place to work with an excellent work culture;;;;;;;
Learning alot about Ecommerce and customizable payment systems for BGs;;;;;;;
I worked there as they were a client for my company;;;;;;;
 It was a good place to work;;;;;;;
 Good atmosphere and qualified coworkers;;;;;;;
Microsoft is exciting and very fast paced;;;;;;;
 Management is more about making money than assisting you in your development;;;;;;;
 Extremely political atmosphere, almost toxic;;;;;;;
Alstom is a great place to work;;;;;;;
,It wasn't what I was looking for;;;;;;;

Great work experience, get it done and learn work environment, mid grade pay, awesome benefits;;;;;;;
 co workers are smart and driven;;;;;;;
Accenture for me is the Best Place to Work;;;;;;;
,The work might be drowning at times but there is still work and life balance;;;;;;;
 ,I like how the company embrace their Core Values and see it on the operations floor in action;;;;;;;
 ,They invest a lot in Organizational Development and Training;;;;;;;
"""Dog-Eat-Dog"" culture";;;;;;;
 Hard to trust anybody;;;;;;;
 Rampant favoritism;;;;;;;
 Highly compliant workforce;;;;;;;
 No work/life balance;;;;;;;

My experience working in Accenture was amazing, everyday was a challenge with news projects, different mythologies to learn and to improve, but with the support of the all team was easier;;;;;;;
 With Accenture I learned how to work in a team, how to build and finish a project, how to work in a cooperative ambient;;;;;;;
,The hardest part of the job was when some unexpected issues came up and need to be done yes or yes, this company push you up for never give up;;;;;;;
,The best part is the amazing people that work in this company;;;;;;;
Accenture is very good organization for working;;;;;;;
 I'm working there since more than 6 years, and really found this as a great place for work;;;;;;;
 The day last around 10 hours in office, which is too long and makes it difficult to make a balance in work and life;;;;;;;
 On technology front I have learnt many thing here, the best about Accenture is you can learn what do you want to learn;;;;;;;
 Management here is too good and keeps you motivated for your career aspirations;;;;;;;
Day to day dealing with customer in regards to energy queries;;;;;;;
,Personally learned how to deal with many different types of customer;;;;;;;
If you have passion for IT, it is the company to start with;;;;;;;
 The training and work system is great;;;;;;;
Too focused on internal perceptions and completely miss the need to put the client front and central;;;;;;;
It was clean and fully protective environment;;;;;;;
 Working in clean-room environment was not ideal for my situation but I think it is good;;;;;;;
Very cooperating techteam,Proper resolution to any issues on time;;;;;;;
Every day was a learning experience, no two days the same,Meeting lots of interesting and diverse customer;;;;;;;
,Manager very ambitious and competitive, co worker supportive, equally competitive and friendly;;;;;;;
,Due to high level of compliance not been always able to provide customers with their desired expectations;;;;;;;
,The variety of the tasks and being helpful, courteous and a sense of achievement meeting targets and customer service;;;;;;;
Good place to start your career if you join the right group with robust revenues and find a partner willing to coach, but they are few and far between;;;;;;;
" The best groups are nationwide, and with 100% travel, you will see the ""bigs"" - the most complex and interesting issues/industries";;;;;;;
" The culture is cutthroat competitive - partner revenue squabbles abound, professionals 'hoard"" work to make sure they meet their billable hours goals, and no one wants to do a thing that's not going to advance their career";;;;;;;
 Partner revenue constrains cross group/region client service and negatively impacts your career development;;;;;;;
 Training is whatever you can figure out on your own or pick up from a webinar on our own time - don't ask too many questions - managers DO NOT consider staff development part of their job;;;;;;;
 Get your CPA/ EA before you join this organization, there is NO time to study;;;;;;;
 In promotion, marked preference is given to caucasian, sports addicted males - diversity is just good spin;;;;;;;
" Expect to ""commute"" from 1";;;;;;;
5 to 2;;;;;;;
"5 hours each way to client and work 12 hours (hotel stays for staff cut into ?? overhead they ""allocate"" to each engagement)";;;;;;;
You will log 80+ hours to get 55 billable hours weekly during busy season - and busy season is 8;;;;;;;
5 months of the year;;;;;;;
,If you survive it all, it's good experience to have early on in your career;;;;;;;
 Learn as much as you can and use the insider view to evaluate where you want to work next;;;;;;;

,Learnt may things;;;;;;;
,Work life balance;;;;;;;
,Independence;;;;;;;
,Employee friendly firm;;;;;;;
There wasn't a typical day at work, which made it interesting, but also difficult to predict or make solid plans;;;;;;;
 I learned a different method of doing things as well as different tax issues;;;;;;;
 Management and scheduling was difficult to access and disjointed, and it was difficult to get clarity as to what projects to prioritize and the path to progression;;;;;;;
 I can't say I got to know all my co-workers that well and there were integration/cultural differences, but the ones I did were personable and enjoyable to work with and everyone was generally hard working individuals;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job was figuring out a path to progression as well as getting acclimated to the group and learning how the structure operated as well as seeing a large number of people come/go so quickly;;;;;;;
" The most enjoyable part of the job was working on some high profile clients and with the ""junior"" folks on a one-on-one basis and watching them show what they could do";;;;;;;
Got many challenging key roles to play in Accenture and learned a lot about people management , cutting edge technologies and budgeting;;;;;;;
 Infact got opportunities to work for projects from initial phase till the maintenance phase thus learned a lot;;;;;;;
I get to talk about all sorts of Microsoft products and services;;;;;;;
 It's usually a fun time in the unpredictable setting of New York, the environment welcomes all sorts of characters both employed or as customer or simple passerby's;;;;;;;
 I've had the privilege of dabbling in the most basic of customer service duties to more advanced, branch-out roles such as inventory, administration, merchandising, and technical support;;;;;;;
Not many places allow for such well-rounded growth;;;;;;;
Accenture offers lots of learning and growing opportunity, its all you have to be extra flexible;;;;;;;
,Management is good, but not up to the mark of a MNC;;;;;;;
Very Good company to learn and apply new things;;;;;;;
,Work Life balance with Job security;;;;;;;
 People are also nice;;;;;;;
Employee friendly company and its fun to work in BNP Paribas ISPL;;;;;;;
It was a great experience working in Microsoft campus, A typical day starts sharp at 9:30 and over the course it had always been a fun filled atmosphere;;;;;;;
 Not only the great challenging work and smart people to work with, there were many indoor games on the floor;;;;;;;
  My favorite being -Foosball;;;;;;;
 During my time off from work, entire team used to go around the floor and look for Foosball, Snooker, TT tables to be empty;;;;;;;
 ,Hardest part during this period was those long lasting work hours, late night hours, but never felt a pinch of stressful feeling as it was always fun working in campus even during that odd hours;;;;;;;
  ,Great learning, great entertainment,glad I had an opportunity to work in the campus;;;;;;;
There was always something to do;;;;;;;

 You know what is required of you but no training is provided;;;;;;;
 Depending upon the location you are stationed within advancement is a long shot;;;;;;;
a great place to work at, get to grow technically as well personally;;;;;;;
 Fun loving people and at the same time highly professional;;;;;;;
-Great, talented people;;;;;;;
 Probably will never get to work with such a big pool of great people elsewhere;;;;;;;
,-A steep learning curve;;;;;;;
 Definitely great place to learn about accounting, audit, and management,-Busy during busy season;;;;;;;
 Could be stressful but firm really supports each individual;;;;;;;
When engagements gets wrapped up;;;;;;;
,Learned to strive for efficiency & effectiveness;;;;;;;
,Management is good;;;;;;;
,Co-workers are excellent;;;;;;;
,Hardest part of the job, is when you clarify the risk of the practical grounds to the top management;;;;;;;

 Hardest part is integrate with system that used here;;;;;;;
The organization was established in 1859 and we are committed now more than ever to helping clients meet financial goals in all stages of their lives;;;;;;;
 One of the hallmarks of our proud heritage is providing world-class customer service;;;;;;;
Working at Ernst and Young was an incredible honor and an awesome experience;;;;;;;
 I gained so many skills from this internship and got connected with many powerful people;;;;;;;
 But most of all, everybody made me feel like I was apart of the team;;;;;;;
I love working here, but opportunity to switch field to allow career growth is very limited;;;;;;;
A challenging environment, with a large array of projects from various fields such as energy, judicial and manufacturing;;;;;;;
I EXPERIENCE RACISM AGAINST WHITE PEOPLE THERE IS AN INBAlANCE OF TO Many blacks;;;;;;;
The busy seasons at EY involved very long hours with tight deadlines;;;;;;;
 However, this lasts for less than half a year and the remainder of the year is less hectic;;;;;;;
 You learn how to multi-task and manage your time;;;;;;;
 You also learn how to communicate and develop your skills very quickly;;;;;;;
 The advantage is that you have a close-knit group of colleagues and active social life outside of the busy season;;;;;;;
Worked whole night on 31/03/13 ( 32 hrs - from 7 am on 31st to 3 pm on 1st April with a minimum gap in between )  to close yearly accounts;;;;;;;
 And , that could be possible with the  help of my colleagues ;;;;;;;
It was a memorable day for me during my service life;;;;;;;
 Furthermore , superiors are very nice and supportive always;;;;;;;
Good place to work at with loads of fun activities and regular fun events;;;;;;;
,However, lots of work pressure and 10 hours of working;;;;;;;
I would recommend Microsoft as an employee, They have great benefits along with great co workers;;;;;;;
 They made the workplace enjoyable and prepared;;;;;;;
If you are looking for a corporate career with suits, ties, long hours, and the prestige of all that comes along with it, then this is the perfect company for you;;;;;;;
 They do a great job at cultivating their employees and assisting them in growing their careers;;;;;;;
 Just as long as you are willing to put in the hours and follow their procedures and guidelines, you will be a huge success;;;;;;;

Microsoft is an amazing place to work;;;;;;;
 Your success depends a lot on your team;;;;;;;
 Most people are really nice and accommodating;;;;;;;

working for long hours like 30hrs continuesly, worked culture is good, I had improved my skills professionally and in personal too;;;;;;;
Can rate Deloitte as best company to work;;;;;;;

invests in growth of employees;;;;;;;
 provides ample opportunities for employees to prove themselves and to grow;;;;;;;
Its a good company to be;;;;;;;
 Nothing more to say;;;;;;;

Microsoft is a great place to work,,lots of room to grow and , and great pay and benefits package,,They have a diverse group of employees,;;;;;;;
A decent place to work while driving cars;;;;;;;
,The best part about this job was having free time on the van rides back to the assembly line to converse with co-workers;;;;;;;
Challenging opportunities,We had a 24hour TAT for our work, which sometimes led to stretching for long hours;;;;;;;
 Management is employee friendly;;;;;;;
A typical day at work ,when we use to get NEW Business requirement, Day by day its getting easier to understand the Functional and business requirement;;;;;;;

Great place to work ;;;;;;;
lots of opportunity for growth;;;;;;;
 Owned day to day business relationship with Client and all Internal Teams;;;;;;;
This personally taught me what industry I should avoid, as I discovered that it wasn't tailored to me;;;;;;;
 It taught me also how to improve my presentation skills and the different dimensions to the professional services industry;;;;;;;
Great place to learn and grow,great career opportunities,transparent work culture,emphasis on trainings and upskilling;;;;;;;
Working at Allianz is exciting and rewarding due to the different situations we assist our clients with, from travel to theft assistance;;;;;;;
I absolutely could not fault the salary and benefits that came with being a 'customer service adviser' at EDF Energy's customer contact center, which is why I stuck with it for so long;;;;;;;
 but I am honestly not joking when I say that working there for as long as I did caused serious mental health issues up to/including anxiety attacks and suicidal ideation - there's a reason call centres like this experience an extremely high staff turnover!,If you genuinely care about providing good customer service, this is not the company for you;;;;;;;
 The work is managed and evaluated on a purely statistical basis with *very* high pressure on advisers to deal with as many calls per hour as possible and with as many energy plan products or direct debit commitments sold as possible;;;;;;;
" This can prove tricky as outwardly the call center is promoted as the main customer point of contact for problems surrounding their energy supply/billing; *not* as a sales center";;;;;;;
 ,Those who are deemed to be effective workers are the advisers with a knack for finding ways of 'dumping' customers with more complex problems on to other advisers who have previously dealt with a customer's query/complaint or those able to transfer them through to other departments on the flimsiest of excuses;;;;;;;
 This allows them to take more calls per hour and increase their chances of promoting sales products to receptive callers (not to mention justify more breaks than just the minimum 36 minute lunch within an eight hour shift);;;;;;;
 Unfortunatley it also results in many customers going round in circles without actually being helped and;;;;;;;
it was a good company to work for friendly clean and smart uniform free tea and coffee god manement good long hours I was running team off workers  and I worked with the lads so we all could meet dead lines iff the had Nissan in Lincoln I would work for them again;;;;;;;
Smart colleagues,Good opportunities if you enjoy the high pressure consulting environment,Enjoyed the strategic projects;;;;;;;
 typical day at work is energetic,2;;;;;;;
 every day is a new learning,3;;;;;;;
 management is supportive;;;;;;;
 co-workers are competitive;;;;;;;
 hardest part of my job is sit with less work occasionally,6;;;;;;;
 enjoyable part of my job is that i love my job and do it with complete interest by putting my 100 %;;;;;;;
It's an assembly line;;;;;;;
work hard ;;;;;;;
don't take day off and don't ever make a mistake;;;;;;;
 Extreme micro management;;;;;;;
 New underwriting unit lead constantly puts underwriters down;;;;;;;
 Before then it was a great place to work;;;;;;;
not a place I would ever recommend going again;;;;;;;
Technology is advance but my job role is limited;;;;;;;
 Very flexible hours;;;;;;;
 Food is great;;;;;;;
 Love to be full time but I am contractor so this had to come to an end;;;;;;;
Good Exposure while working with Accenture, i have learnt a lot here, management is quite good will support you to groom your self and support you in order to be innovative;;;;;;;
Overall a good company to work with;;;;;;;
 Individual gets multiple options in terms of projects and locations to work ;;;;;;;
The best part of working for this organisation is sharing the working space with professional individuals who share their knowledge and experience;;;;;;;
Learn from different professionals with different capabilities & talents and also in different countries;;;;;;;
Should focus on keeping standart better in terms of training;;;;;;;
This is one the  best companies I have every worked with;;;;;;;
 Its a Five star company, on the whole a superb company to work with;;;;;;;
putting parts out for production line, loading and unloading the lorries, all so when need I was team leader which involved making sure the production lines were stocked up right, and to make sure the work place was clean and tidy;;;;;;;
Deloitte's professionals know exactly what they are doing;;;;;;;
 Deloitte's professionals set high standards, and consistently deliver;;;;;;;
,Their project expectations and planning is excellent;;;;;;;
 Most top level management folks are extremely smart and have a great sense of vision and planning;;;;;;;
 Upper level partners are extremely engaging and with the new performance management system in testing - there is huge opportunity to set the standard globally for our talent;;;;;;;
Awesome and friendly place to work;;;;;;;
  Great working environment and perks;;;;;;;
  Always supportive of new ideas and encourages  initiatives;;;;;;;
EY is a flexible work place;;;;;;;
 There is not much work pressure and I like the work culture;;;;;;;
 But in terms of salary and benefits it has good scope once you have invested a long career in the firm;;;;;;;
Great place to work with with co-workers;;;;;;;
 Had a phenomenal company culture centered around a work hard-play hard environment;;;;;;;
 Employees are valued and there is limitless advancement possibilities;;;;;;;
I enjoy being part of one of the biggest group in the industry of electronic;;;;;;;
 I can benefit of an highly qualified and experienced team, they teach me a lot and bring motivation;;;;;;;
,The group's stability and its reputation are an advantage;;;;;;;
It's good;;;;;;;
,I learnt many things in this organisation and it's really a good place to work and grow;;;;;;;
,I have grown a lot in this company;;;;;;;
I have worked at Nissan for past fifteen years with six of those combined with Infiniti brand;;;;;;;
Service personal are always kept up to date with any and all service bulletins, campaigns and service tips on an ongoing daily basis;;;;;;;
 Customer satisfaction is always the bottom line;;;;;;;
Great people to work with;;;;;;;
 Wonderful job to keep as a career with a promising future;;;;;;;
Unfortunately Google works with Staffing Companies that don't have the best benefits;;;;;;;
 ,They have temporary jobs with a max of 2 years contract;;;;;;;
EY is a good place to work and gain experience but they claim to have a good work/life balance and that is not true;;;;;;;
 Most jobs at EY expect you to work a lot of hours throughout the year and if you are not on the client serving side, you do not get the same career guidance and job growth;;;;;;;
 I find it hard to progress at a place like EY without having a CPA;;;;;;;
 The benefits and pay are good if you stay for a number of years and get great reviews;;;;;;;
 In the end, the amount of hours and workloads have no end in sight and employee appreciation is not as positive as in years' past;;;;;;;
 Most of the focus is on increasing revenues and gaining clients;;;;;;;
 There is not a lot of focus on their own people;;;;;;;
Microsoft Global Security is a wonderful group to be affiliated with;;;;;;;
  I have learned many aspects of my job and have been able to work among great friends and colleagues;;;;;;;
  It provides home/work life balance and job security;;;;;;;
  The culture is the best and I am very fortunate to be able to be a part of the experience;;;;;;;
Although there were times in the month by which certain functions needed to be inputted, there wasn't really a typical day;;;;;;;
,I learned how to put together a market report for clients;;;;;;;
 I had never done this sort of research before and I found it extremely satisfying when it was complete;;;;;;;
,My co-workers were incredibly hard working, pleasant, interesting and good fun;;;;;;;
,The hardest part of my job was having an almost four hour journey to and from work and working overtime also;;;;;;;
",I thoroughly enjoyed the excitement of working in the ""city"" though the travel was tiring";;;;;;;
Supporting multiple executives, all levels, with different personalities has kept me on my toes and learning something new and amazing everyday!  Flexible environment, supportive management and amazing teaming;;;;;;;
â€¢ Analysed the performance of Nissanâ€™s activities in order to optimize their management,â€¢ Delivered a set of recommendations that aims to increase dialogue between the different levels hierarchy in order to manage employee stress levels and increase work efficiency;;;;;;;

Working in the mobile phones division has been exciting, rewarding and also challenging - always pushing ourselves to execute new and innovative ways to engage consumers through digital and physical experiences;;;;;;;
 True teamwork across markets, divisions and channels - in an ever changing and challenging environment;;;;;;;
Ernst & Young is the best place to work, there's a lot of flexibility, all we have to do is to provide a quality work for our clients, and EY makes sure its taking care of us;;;;;;;
My role at deloitte was a multi tasked;;;;;;;
 I never said NO to any work and was always upfront to learn new things;;;;;;;
 My co-workers were very supportive and we were really like a team;;;;;;;
 I dint had any issues with management and after leaving the company also I have a good relation with them;;;;;;;
Deloitte is a great place to work as it combines the challenge of engaging work with the best people in the industry;;;;;;;
 There was never a dull moment in my day when I was with Deloitte;;;;;;;
 I led a team of about 25 talented facilitators and coaches;;;;;;;
 Together we created and deployed learning solutions aimed at giving our professionals in India (20,000+) the communication skills they needed to succeed in providing exceptional client service in a global organization;;;;;;;
,As the Learning Lead, I created learning strategies for the team and our clients;;;;;;;
 I led end to end organization-wide learning projects that analysed skill needs, designed and delivered learning solutions and measured their outcomes;;;;;;;
 I interacted regularly with the leaders of our client areas to ensure that the learning needs of their teams were being met;;;;;;;
,I hired, coached and mentored managers and assistant managers who reported to me, planning their career advancement through skillset development;;;;;;;
 The most challenging part of my job was to provide new and interesting channels for the team to apply their creativity and stay highly engaged;;;;;;;
 Though this was not easy, it helped me to experiment with emerging alternative learning practices through virtual platforms and social media;;;;;;;
,With the trust and autonomy invested in me by the leadership, the state of the art infrastructure and a great team, I've done some of my best work at Deloitte;;;;;;;
I do think it depends where you end up and who you end up working with, but Accenture as a whole has come across as a firm that cares only about the profit;;;;;;;
 Individual growth, though encouraged in conversation, isn't truly supported outside of the rhetoric;;;;;;;
 This point itself was frustrating for me, who just came out of college hoping that a bigger firm with Accenture would allow for mobility and invest in training;;;;;;;
 I wasn't able to do either, despite constant articulation of my strong desires to do so;;;;;;;
 Accenture management will tell you that there are resources available for you to do trainings and learnings yourself, but most new hires are put onto projects with no real down-time to allow for such activities;;;;;;;
,A lot of smart, knowledgeable people work at Accenture, but most are above a certain age and few truly care about relaying that information to younger employees;;;;;;;
 The knowledge I gained on my project has come more from the client I work for than internally within Accenture, which shouldn't be the case for a firm that touts their strong company culture;;;;;;;
Pay is inconsistent with workload and there is an emphasis on quantity over quality;;;;;;;
I have learnt a lot and the people at Deloitte are always willing to assist where necessary;;;;;;;
,I have grown professionally and personally;;;;;;;
EY had an excellent work culture;;;;;;;
 Learned a lot about Team Work;;;;;;;
 The only problem was beyond the designation of Advanced Associate, promotions could happen only after 3-5 years of time;;;;;;;
I reported to numerous high profile executives, arranging their calendar, working independently and with my team;;;;;;;
 It was a very organized environment, which I enjoyed;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job was that it was a very busy position;;;;;;;
Hours 9am-6pm, Time Management, and Progressive Software, Management was fair , Very nice Co-workers and Professional Staff on a whole, Most enjoyable part of the job is the Staff interactions, No day is typical;;;;;;;
 Hardest  part of job, knowing when to stop for the day(Me Personally);;;;;;;
1st job will teach u ever thing;;;;;;;
 how to behave to other and co-workers;;;;;;;
 google is a very good company, i like to work with them;;;;;;;
Emphasis in customer support;;;;;;;
 Great benefits and very fun;;;;;;;
 Outstanding HR department which is always in direct contact with you;;;;;;;
Great place to work;;;;;;;
,Great place to meet motivated people;;;;;;;
,The work culture pushes you to improve yourself as an individual and build a brand for yourself;;;;;;;

 Management was in continues follow-ups with S&M team;;;;;;;
 Team member was doing side steps;;;;;;;
 I got snacks for late staying team members;;;;;;;
 ,As it was very late, being team's manager I was trained on each activities, I given my hand for the activity and we ended day after 22 hours;;;;;;;

I would like to look for an administrative / secretarial post with job security and more career development;;;;;;;
I enjoyed my work at Axa Equitable, I learned a lot about the life insurance policies;;;;;;;

 I enjoyed my co-workers;;;;;;;
If you love programming, everything will fall into place;;;;;;;
 Passive-Agressive culture is hard to adapt to at times;;;;;;;
One of the world's leading professional services organizations, helps companies across the globe to identify and capitalize on business opportunities;;;;;;;
Its a fantastic company to work with if some one has to settle down in the life with good salary irrespective of their role and profile;;;;;;;
 ,middle management has to come up with out of the box ideas and try to expand the business and scope instead of squeezing the subordinates for cost cutting and ideas;;;;;;;
,overall good work environment with pleasent ambience,;;;;;;;
I had learned a great deal of Google products and how they work to better an individuals work lifestyle;;;;;;;
 Every day you learn something new and you continue to grow your communication skills because not only are you learning to speak with different people around the world, but you also engage in troubleshooting their needs and collaborate with coworkers to fix the problem;;;;;;;
 Management was very professional, in addition they always check up on you to make sure you perform to company standards while coaching you on whatever skill(s) you need to improve on;;;;;;;
 Hardest part of the job was getting to memorize the policies and rules you had to enforce;;;;;;;
 While the most enjoyable part of the job is getting to walk around and explore the facility during break, having decent food for lunch, and just getting to know everyone was really fun;;;;;;;
Collected and categorized data of questionnaire to analyze and present results for market demand;;;;;;;
,Coordinated client relations through website communicating information between Microsoft Corporation and other cooperation;;;;;;;

 Collaborate with Operations and other departments to develop, review, revise, and maintain the needed KPIs to support efficiency and compliance;;;;;;;
Deloitte is the basis of my career in terms of technical skills;;;;;;;
Worked for a year in the data center and it was very exciting, learned a lot;;;;;;;
 Management were ok but not wow;;;;;;;
EY is a great company, with great people, good pay and a lot of opportunities;;;;;;;
 I would recommend it to anyone pursuing a job in financial services;;;;;;;
Great company & benefits;;;;;;;
 Got acquired by them and they treated me well and had tons for resources to help me grow my skills;;;;;;;
Temporary employees for up to two years with no time off, sick days, or vacation time;;;;;;;
I have developed verity of solutions in different Domains;;;;;;;
 Learned so much, since Accenture provides very good external trainings and it is mandatory for all Microsoft employes to update himself into latest technology, I learned ASP;;;;;;;
NET with MVC, JQuery, JSON, HTML5, MS SQL Server BI etc;;;;;;;
,Work culture is also good;;;;;;;
,Few reasons for looking for new opportunity:-,1;;;;;;;
 Very limited learning for MS technology in my current project and want to switch the job only for good work,2;;;;;;;
 Additionally looking for company who can sponsor for my Green Card;;;;;;;
Interesting starting a Microsoft Practice in a slower moving environment;;;;;;;
 Again, they tended t get in there own way by not being able to allow individual prodictivity;;;;;;;
I learned a lot about computer software, customer service, and how to be helpful to others;;;;;;;
 A typical day included greeting visitors, communicating via email, and learning about computer technology;;;;;;;
 Everyone (guests and co-workers) were from all walks of life which was fascinating;;;;;;;
 Meeting so many new people and working for such a large company was challenging but fun;;;;;;;
Good Company, makes employees productive and people always moving forward;;;;;;;
Has good values and good work environment, the people there are fun to work with and there is lots of opportunities;;;;;;;

Not great like what you think it would be or could be;;;;;;;

Working at this company provided an opportunity to see various different industries while performing audit assignments;;;;;;;
 The company required all audit personnel to achieve the designation of certified public accountant;;;;;;;
 This designation was required in order to advance to a senior level position;;;;;;;
 Training was provided to afford employees with the tools necessary to advance;;;;;;;

Deloitte is a good place to start your career,but not a good place for experience professional;;;;;;;
Getting my feet wet as a hardware/software tester, this was a great place to start having no previous experience;;;;;;;
 The work wasn't the best, and due to the nature of it, the hours were very up and down;;;;;;;
 I got my feet wet here and learned alot about the games industry which pushed me to branch out into different areas/companies in search of the best fit for me;;;;;;;
good company, I like relationship with local peoples;;;;;;;
,good relationship with management;;;;;;;
I worked as part of a new team within office;;;;;;;
 The people I worked with were all friendly but there was a huge sense of pressure to meet deadlines, and daily feature meetings (as part of the switch to a more agile approach) meant your PM was always expecting a clear accounting of what was done and what was going to be done that day;;;;;;;
 This can be stressful for a programmer;;;;;;;
 However, the work was exactly what it should be and the pay was great so all in all a good experience;;;;;;;
A Chartered Accountant with three years of experience at a multinational private professional services organization with expertise in assurance, review, and compliance;;;;;;;

,was lied to by higher management about job security right up until the last moment, and even then they weren't 100% sure that redundancies were happening;;;;;;;
,I learned that management fixed the KPI's to better suit the NHS targets - illegal and immoral;;;;;;;
,Co-workers, mainly the one supervisor, loved to say one thing then do another - also found it in their interest to back up members of staff who didn't pull their weight against better performing colleagues, also loved to give out banter but couldn't ever take it back;;;;;;;
,HR dept;;;;;;;
 a complete joke - didn't know what they were doing at any time;;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of the job was when the ice creme man came;;;;;;;

Deloitte has a culture that is a good fit for those just out of undergraduate or graduate school;;;;;;;
 For those that have more job and life experience it can be difficult to advance your career;;;;;;;
 The company is totally driven by budgets and unfortunately it can stifling to the point of employees leaving due to the politics involved in budgeting process;;;;;;;
 ,Work/Life Balance is average;;;;;;;
 The day doesn't end at 5pm most days and working a long night is somewhat common;;;;;;;
 ,Deloitte tends to utilize contractors for work with the intention of hiring them full time;;;;;;;
 This is rarely the case;;;;;;;
 They struggle with budgeting correctly for the permanent roles;;;;;;;
 This is turn leads to the contractors moving onto their competitors and Deloitte losing some great talent;;;;;;;

But work culture is very nice and even hikes we will the best;;;;;;;
My goal is to learn the new technologies and move forward with the advanced technologies;;;;;;;
Totally career motive firm;;;;;;;
 really enjoyable work here;;;;;;;
 mentors are really good and supportive;;;;;;;
 lots of travel involved within country and out of country;;;;;;;
Good Training Program,Many talents in the company,Multi-tasking skill is important,Many types of clients;;;;;;;
I enjoyed working at EDF Energy and feel i have learnt an awful lot about the company and most of all knowledge on the new SAP computer system;;;;;;;
 i have learnt how to do call handling and learn brilliant customer service skills;;;;;;;
 EDF do not allow permanent contracts, which isn't good for job security;;;;;;;
 Changes happen a lot within the company as in team move arounds and changing of managers so learning to deal with it appropriately, take on board changes quickly and work to best ability is a big part of the roles within the business;;;;;;;
Good Work environment;;;;;;;
 Fiendly attitude with all employess;;;;;;;
Very flexible company with great learning and good people;;;;;;;
It s a great place to where you learn everyday;;;;;;;
 But the work is never ending;;;;;;;
 The compensation is very low compared to other jobs in the industry, especially with the hours and effort that you invest;;;;;;;
I have always cherished my days at Accenture;;;;;;;
 It was a great place to work;;;;;;;
,I was always appreciated for my work;;;;;;;
 The work-personal life balance was good;;;;;;;
 Received a lot of perks;;;;;;;
Handling the implementation of new IT projects & insures the involvement of BNPP Egypt business lines;;;;;;;
Accenture has vibrant culture to work and stay and progress;;;;;;;
,It provides good opportunity to work with client interfacing roles;;;;;;;
Ability to integrate the team and accumulation of new knowledge;;;;;;;
Comunication,;;;;;;;
Help the team and customer safety;;;;;;;
My experience at Deloitte was amazing;;;;;;;
 The Deloitte culture prides itself on its core values with an emphasis on Diversity and Inclusion, and overall home-work life balance;;;;;;;
Good company with good values and people;;;;;;;
 Good benefits,But is an outsourcing company where you unknown  if contract renovate;;;;;;;
I did it for 3;;;;;;;
5 years, just be wary of the sacrifice required in terms of work life balance;;;;;;;
 IT M&A can be specially bad in that regard, be smart about choosing your project teams and your managers;;;;;;;
 Some PPD's and senior managers have gamed the system, and are able to stay in even though they demoralize employees;;;;;;;
Very difficult work life balance;;;;;;;
 Opportunity available but come with a cost to your personal life;;;;;;;
Great place to start a career;;;;;;;
 Working with young and dynamic people is great;;;;;;;
,Long hours are a must but the experience is great!;;;;;;;
i used to work on my own although i was a part of a big team;;;;;;;
,i learned to deal with different cultures,i had 3 managers one in south africa other in saui arabia and other in cairo;;;;;;;
Sherwin-Williams has good pay and decent benefits however the work-life balance is poor, management is poor, and it trickles down;;;;;;;
 Every single manager in the district was not happy and the best ones have left or will leave to pursue much better opportunities;;;;;;;
 Good first job out of college;;;;;;;
AMBIENTE DE TRABALHO MUITO BOM,GESTORES COMPETENTES E PARTICIPATIVOS COM OS FUNCIONÃÅRIOS,EXCELENTES BENEFÃçCIOS,EXCELENTE PLANO DE CARREIRA;;;;;;;

 One of the best places to work at;;;;;;;
Day-to-day Microsoft is generally fun, though how much fun depends on the team you are working with;;;;;;;
 The company is slowly trying to reinvent itself for a modern world, and sometimes fails to grasp the basics necessary for this task;;;;;;;
,The company is generally good to work for, but some times seems driven more by doing what's right for the stock price instead of what's right for the customer and the employee;;;;;;;
Work culture is good,Was part of the pilot process,Good experience,Was into investigation process and had to find out the money flow and rectify in case if it is credited wrongly;;;;;;;
Ernst and Young is a great employer;;;;;;;
 There is immense learning potential for anyone who wants to join this firm;;;;;;;
,Ernst and young grooms you  as a strong professional;;;;;;;
The focus is on what you deliver and the environment is tailored to bring out the best in you;;;;;;;
Microsoft is a very dynamic place to work with extremely talented people;;;;;;;
Based on my tenure about 10 years ago, Deloitte as a brand is well known and the association I have had has been a good one;;;;;;;
 It is a great place to begin your career;;;;;;;
Work life balance is great;;;;;;;
 They give great flexibility to balance work and life;;;;;;;
easy job fun to work somtimes;;;;;;;
 owner likes to be treated like a king;;;;;;;
,not good job security;;;;;;;
* My first company was Accenture, so I had pretty good learning and the best place to begin your career with;;;;;;;
,* Management was good,* had pretty good amount of fun time at the office with team members;;;;;;;
I build engines on an assembly line;;;;;;;
 It is very hard work;;;;;;;
 Some days are good days and some are bad;;;;;;;
 I have a few co workers that I have made friends with;;;;;;;
 The management isn't the greatest but they get the job done;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of working there is the line speed;;;;;;;
 The line moves really fast;;;;;;;
Good company & highly talented set of professionals;;;;;;;
 It got great pool of talent & the best part is its diversity;;;;;;;
 the scale of operations is huge at deloitte serving both US & india;;;;;;;
Involves team work, I was exposed to different industries, the hardest part of thejob is meeting the dead lines when the client is not cooporating;;;;;;;
Deloitte - Brand Name - Big Fours' - External Audit for basically Australian, US,  Canada, UK clients;;;;;;;
 It offers & provide CPA courses as well;;;;;;;
Great management,Wonderful work environment,Family orieneted;;;;;;;
Very hard work, so many resources available to get a very high quality work and access to the best methodologies;;;;;;;
,I learn how to perfect my presentations skills and to work directly with the client;;;;;;;
 ,How to work in teams in order to success in a project by bringing the best of the different integrants;;;;;;;
,Lots of pressure because deadlines, lack hours of sleep,Once a project is implemented successfully is the best feeling ever;;;;;;;
Professionalism was always the priority;;;;;;;
 Many learning opportunities available;;;;;;;
Learned a lot, great place to work, no work life balance during busy seasn;;;;;;;
Have a very good experience in Deloitte;;;;;;;
 One of the best to work;;;;;;;
Good exposure to,Agile Scaled Framework process,,stake holder management,,communication management,,program management,,cross functional team management,,user acceptance testing management,,product release management,,deployment management;;;;;;;
,Very good place to learn;;;;;;;
i learned to work with other and understand others and help them;;;;;;;
I had a wonderful experience working at deloitte;;;;;;;
,Best points about them were :,1;;;;;;;
 Flexibility they provide,2;;;;;;;
Compensation benefits,3;;;;;;;
 Best job culture,4;;;;;;;
 Value given to the employees;;;;;;;
A typical work day consisted of first, logging into a given Android device, picking the orders shown, paying for them with a given Google credit card, and packing the purchased items securely for take off by the GSX Hub drivers;;;;;;;
 I learned how to think quickly on solutions to speed up our production, as we had to meet a set amount of pack cut off times for same-day deliveries;;;;;;;
 This was very challenging at least 80% of the time due to either poor connectivity with androids, packing printers, and low amounts of packing supplies at our workstations;;;;;;;
 I learned how to better have an adaptive working-style, whether I am placed alone at a vendor location or with a GSX team;;;;;;;
" We were to contact or ""reach out"" to management via email using our android phones if problems arose";;;;;;;
 Most of the time it would take a while to get a response, so problem-solving on your own or with your team was definitely a must;;;;;;;
 Mostly ALL of my co-workers were really great to work with;;;;;;;
 To be the most productive, it took great communication and jumping in where needed regardless of our set role that day, and we mastered that work flow;;;;;;;
 This to me, was the most enjoyable part of the job, an awesome crew;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to make cut offs on time when the equipment given to us malfunctioned, and having to wait on email responses when reaching out about low packing supplies or other hiccups of the day;;;;;;;
 I would say that our management would sometimes bypass/miss our concerns all together by not thoroughly reading emails;;;;;;;
I am currently in the Proyect and Structured Finance team at BNP Paribas;;;;;;;
Productive and fun workplace;;;;;;;
 The work place to be at!! A place where team mates are like a family and no seniority levels shown by the seniors!!;;;;;;;
My Typical day at work is to check the business are processed correctly or not;;;;;;;
 If they are not meeting the standards we should send them back to the people to make the changes and send them to Verification queue to send the process live;;;;;;;
 I used to learn lot of things from France and other french speaking countries because i was hired for that specific language process;;;;;;;
My Team and job was also very good;;;;;;;
Deloitte has been a great platform for a career within the financial services industry;;;;;;;
 Taking the skills, experience and exposure I have gained, I am now looking for a new challenge and career advancement;;;;;;;
Workers are very nice and friendly;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable job I had;;;;;;;
Great place to work, great atmosphere and co workers;;;;;;;
 Pay, benefits and training was above average;;;;;;;
 Great chance for advancement but let go of people just as quickly as they hired;;;;;;;
This company is going down hill very fast;;;;;;;
 Managers punish you and don't keep promises;;;;;;;
 Not a real sales environment and not a good place for gaining sales experience;;;;;;;
The company has given me great opportunity to work outside our country, develop and enhance my skills;;;;;;;
 To lead an independent team, to work directly with clients, to be challenged everyday are one of the few things I enjoy in the company;;;;;;;
I am challenged every day by working on meaningful projects;;;;;;;
I work in a number of interesting subject areas;;;;;;;
 The work culture is very positive;;;;;;;
 The pay and benefits are quite good;;;;;;;
Its productive and fun work place,provide work flexibility,Great place to learn thingsExtended working hours, work life imbalance;;;;;;;
A typical day at the workplace included technical updates of all production processing;;;;;;;
 Monitoring SAP production & timesharing;;;;;;;
 Monitoring updates of Business Warehouse (Intelligence);;;;;;;
 Processing payrolls and bank transmissions;;;;;;;
 Invoice updates through EDI (Electronic Document Interchange);;;;;;;

 thats very enjoyable moment of my life;;;;;;;
 field force all colleague & officers are good cooperative;;;;;;;
Accenture is a stable company with good reputation;;;;;;;
The reason I'm leaving is because I'm looking for a daytime job;;;;;;;
 I'm having of second though of leaving as they have retirement pay;;;;;;;
 But I'm considering health prolong working an night;;;;;;;
My experience with Accenture has helped me grow as a professional in the IT industry;;;;;;;
,The people at Accenture are very friendly and the work environment is very productive;;;;;;;
 ,The hardest and the most enjoyable part of the job is to drive client calls in the middle of the night;;;;;;;
I gained an invaluable amount of experience at Deloitte and was exposed to various high risk clients and confidential information and I've always taken a particularly keen interest in Forensics over the years and I felt this job could provide me with the perfect scope to acquire knowledge and showcase my skills;;;;;;;
 We worked well as a team and achieved our objectives in a timely fashion and management was always very understanding of our perspectives and values and they were always patient;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part was getting access and scrutinizing the confidential information on high risk clients, but I also enjoyed working in a dynamic and team orientated environment that constantly pushes you;;;;;;;
A good place to Learn and earn;;;;;;;
 Excellent organization to work with;;;;;;;
Being privileged to work in the finance department for a software company, the atmosphere is slightly more relaxed and quieter while still maintaining a high level of professionalism;;;;;;;
 Our hours are flexible depending on deadlines like month end closing for example;;;;;;;
 The management treat all employees with the highest level of respect and praise;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of my job is probably the last 4 days of the month when we look towards closing the month end accounts;;;;;;;
 We generally are incredibly busy with journal entries and nominal postings for our consolidated accounts;;;;;;;
 ,As my roll is predominately operations so I enjoy taking on new challenges and daily tasks that fall my way;;;;;;;
This firm allowed me to have a lot of flexibility with my life;;;;;;;
 I also found the firm to hire all smart, ambitious, and creative people;;;;;;;
We always worked as a team and always have support from my peers as well as offer support to them;;;;;;;
Deloitte was a good firm to work for;;;;;;;
 I had a decent work experience there;;;;;;;
 I learned about the various personalities of people from various backgrounds & ethnicities;;;;;;;
 The majority of my co-workers were warm-hearted people;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of working in Deloitte was dealing with deadlines, which were beyond my control;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job was working with people who appreciated my hard work;;;;;;;
Friendly work culture with one of the best working atmosphere, strong values, and most efficient work force;;;;;;;
it was my finest experience to be part of Microsoft;;;;;;;
Learned everything about managing handling client relationships and how to deliver within allotted deadlines;;;;;;;
 improved report writing skills and provided training to juniors;;;;;;;
A very friendly atmosphere with smart and experienced colleagues;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the day was the commute but it was worth the experience;;;;;;;
Direct Partner/Customer calls;;;;;;;
,I enjoy my job reason, I am passionate about sales;;;;;;;
 I love sales, marketing, meeting people and talking about my products and I love travelling the most;;;;;;;
Good Place to work and to gain good experience;;;;;;;
 Nice product and team work;;;;;;;
 Culture was awesome and colleagues are supportive;;;;;;;
 Want one more chance to work like that Orzn;;;;;;;
Google is an amazing place to work with quiet work areas , great cafes and great ways to relax and decompress;;;;;;;
Accenture is a great company and brand name;;;;;;;
 It has hired lot of people and is delivering business in all areas of market very successfully;;;;;;;
  Its a very good experience for career to begin with;;;;;;;
 ,As in with any big company, the organization is just too big;;;;;;;
 Its hard to know people;;;;;;;
 Often new comers get lost and some quit;;;;;;;
 Attrition rate is high at this point;;;;;;;
 ,Overall, good company, good benefits, just need to work on organization to keep people around for longer duration so that people feel they belong in the organization and give better productivity;;;;;;;
Lots of work, challenging but not the best when you have a family and other responsibilities besides work;;;;;;;
good company to work for with great benefits and good equipment;;;;;;;
Microsoft is an exciting company to work at and the new CEO is making all the right moves to take the company in the direction it needs to go;;;;;;;
Big firm focused on accounting related services;;;;;;;

 Opportunities to be involved in many tasks and learn a wide range of skills;;;;;;;
EY was a great company to work with a great career plan;;;;;;;
 I learned a lot there and now I am able to work at many different areas due to the variety of work I've done there;;;;;;;
,The hardest part are the long work hours and the impossibility to study at a college or school when you work there;;;;;;;
,The best part was the big companies you get to know and the different ways of work;;;;;;;
At slightly higher levels, e;;;;;;;
 Lead level, it becomes all about who you please and project yourself to;;;;;;;
 You need to know the political arena and be willing to play in it;;;;;;;
Very intensive working day with all activity monitored and personal statistics published weekly;;;;;;;
 Management are extremely helpful and the company uses psychology extensively to boost morale and create an ethos of competitiveness regarding targets;;;;;;;
 ,Whilst phone work is highly restrictive and constantly monitored, feedback is given, which encourages many;;;;;;;
 ,The worst part of the job is having little or no autonomy;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part is knowing you are part of a team and staff are exceptionally nice;;;;;;;
I learned a lot to Accenture especially to their process and how to handle a task in a professional way;;;;;;;
 Dealing with the employees request is very challenging e specially if the request is for our Boss and Exec;;;;;;;
I enjoy to working with my colleagues because even if we are stress at work we have a our recreation area where we can use our videoke after office and break time to enjoy the busy day;;;;;;;
The hardest part of this job since we are processing millions amount of budget is to make sure that all details is correct and accurate since it will be a big challenge if you have forgot to include other request taht should be for budget on that month of accrual;;;;;;;
RENAULT-VAAL IS A CAR DEALRSHIP AND SERVICE AND PARTS FRANCHISE I ENJOY WORKING HERE WE ARE REALY BUSY AND SERIOUS ABOUT WHAT WE DO;;;;;;;

 Worked as an auditor there, lead the team and learned alot;;;;;;;
This place was a excellent place to work;;;;;;;
 Here we are aible to learn about everything the supervisor was good and also the people who you can work with is amazing;;;;;;;
 Great place to grow up and also to learn about sales;;;;;;;
One could work as much or as little as one desired;;;;;;;
 However, there was no phone number to call to speak to anyone at the head office;;;;;;;
 All correspondence - including hiring interviews - were done over the internet in writing or test-taking format;;;;;;;
 There was no advancement, no job security, no way to speak to management, and culture was the environment created in your own home;;;;;;;
 Identities of other raters were kept confidential, so there was no co-worker interaction at all;;;;;;;
I worked in a team to set up business processes for a major telecommunications client, who had introduced a new brand of internet service provider;;;;;;;
 My primary tasks included developing process flow diagrams to illustrate various business functions, and work instructions for call centre agents who handled customer-related issues;;;;;;;
Job role was mundane, lesser and limited empowerment to take decisions, co workers and colleagues mostly friendly and helpful,,enjoyed flexible work arrangements and salary benefits,,Work culture,business stakeholders difficult to have an open door policy;;;;;;;

 It is a highly reputable firm with excellent professional environment with growth opportunities;;;;;;;
 It provided me diversified work experience with entities in different sectors and also provided me opportunities to interact and deal with top level management;;;;;;;
This is a great place to work but takes a lot of time;;;;;;;
 You spend most of your days at work and since you are working on a global project there is a high level of stress;;;;;;;
Highly  professional;;;;;;;
 Very organized  ;;;;;;;
 and excellent team members,good to work with ;;;;;;;
room for self development and growth ,mutual respect  and support ;;;;;;;

Good company to work for;;;;;;;
  However you may not always end up doing what you were hired for;;;;;;;
  Good for beginners;;;;;;;
  Promotion and pay raise system need to be reworked;;;;;;;
I am thankful for being a part of my previous company, in three years of working with them I learnt how to work confidently under pressure, meet deadlines, to be punctual and how to communicate well with co employees, management and especially with customers;;;;;;;
,It was indeed hard initially to solve the  queries but with the great management support and self initiative in 6 months awards for customer satisfaction and training sessions were conducted by me for the new joiners;;;;;;;
Competitive environment, like most things you get out of t whatever you put into it;;;;;;;
 Great place to grow and learn new skills;;;;;;;
Day started with normal work pressure,I learnt many process related and non-process related works, which include processing of different case types, receive client calls, actively involved in conducting seminars and meetings for process related updates;;;;;;;
,co-workers are very helpful in learning process related updates,shift timings were hardest part of the job,Work satisfaction in Pharmacovigilance;;;;;;;
Accenture is a very good place to be  , the management always hear you and they try to solve your concerns;;;;;;;
 They give you the flexibility to work at your timings;;;;;;;
A good and organized company;;;;;;;
 Both co workers and manager are nice and friendly;;;;;;;
 In addition, I have so many chance to learn in here;;;;;;;
Great place to launch a career as you get to work with many different types of people in different geographies and experience a variety of projects;;;;;;;
The colleagues are fun but work is boring and pay is not good;;;;;;;
 Not challenging enough;;;;;;;
 Not enough avenues for advancement;;;;;;;
Microsoft has a culture that supports diversity and provides competitive benefits;;;;;;;
 Employees at Microsoft are intelligent and motivated people, with a passion for software;;;;;;;
 The services division of Microsoft is continuing to evolve as the company shifts to a focus on Devices and Services in the cloud;;;;;;;
Great work experience overall;;;;;;;
 Very enjoyable work environment;;;;;;;
 Learned a lot about the industry;;;;;;;
 Gained valuable knowledge and skills for the field;;;;;;;
contractor's not treated as same as employee, no chance of hire,experience not realy qualification to get hired its who you know;;;;;;;
Working in AXA is a great experience;;;;;;;
 Of my 6 years journey with AXA, I learnt many technologies, faced many challenges which helped me to groom myself;;;;;;;
 Co-workers at AXA are very friendly and always guide people with their expertise in technology;;;;;;;
 Most enjoyable part of AXA is the work culture and co-workers;;;;;;;
I have spent my whole carreer so far Deloitte;;;;;;;
 I would like to continue working for Deloitte in the US;;;;;;;
 It was a great learning experience;;;;;;;
Great place for personal development but not the best place for work/life balance;;;;;;;
A different work culture where the management gives a lot flexibility to the workers;;;;;;;
The work asks for tremendous coding skills;;;;;;;
 As it is my first full time job, it taught me some different aspects on how to survive in the Corporate world;;;;;;;
,The environment inside is basically dependent on the client you are serving for;;;;;;;
Accenture is a demanding company and I have learned how to manage change on a regular basis;;;;;;;
 The people with in Accenture are amazing and hard working;;;;;;;

 Ive learned how to work as a team, as well as individually;;;;;;;
how to get along well with co-workers;;;;;;;
I have made an effort to develop my skills and experience in numerous different ways;;;;;;;
Deloitte is an amazing company to start of your career;;;;;;;

,The employees were stressed out at the end of the day,Management is good;;;;;;;
,The hardest part is to stay all day taking calls;;;;;;;
Excellent training,Smart, capable staff;;;;;;;
,There can be a lot of opportunity if you are positioned well and have the right connections;;;;;;;
,Merit, dedication and commitment to client are not key factors in advancement;;;;;;;
 Group think is highly encouraged and most often rewarded;;;;;;;
,Individuality is stifled by red-tape and improper assessment and allocation of resource skills;;;;;;;
I've worked as an executive assistant and office manager for over 14 years;;;;;;;
 I have supported multiple C-Suite executives and found the key to providing excellent support is to build an excellent relationship with your executive;;;;;;;
 Adapt your style to meet their needs;;;;;;;
 Being flexible is key to any success you will have in your career;;;;;;;
 Keep abreast of the business you're in;;;;;;;
 Learn the new technology;;;;;;;
 Embrace change;;;;;;;
 You may have a plan for your day but be prepared to handle to anything that comes your way;;;;;;;
" Don't get marred down in what the 'problem' is; come up with a solution and move on";;;;;;;
,In my experience no 2 days are a the same;;;;;;;
 You have to be able get your day to day duties complete and handle all of the days surprises;;;;;;;
 Meet each deadline;;;;;;;
 Keep the lines of communication open;;;;;;;
 Ask questions, accept help and insight from your peers and executives;;;;;;;
 Feedback is key and is a 2-way street;;;;;;;
 Don't be afraid to ask for help as we all need it;;;;;;;
Accenture as an organization provides many opportunities to an individual to grow not only in the technical terms but also in the functional terms which helps the individual to grow holistically;;;;;;;
Generally on any given day you are expected to complete your assigned work within the time frame provided but you will get all the support and encouragement if you are not able to do so from your superiors;;;;;;;
 There are times where you have to do a bit of documentation which sometimes seems to be repetitive but is necessary but for many individual who like to attach themselves more to the technology aspect of any project may seem to be futile;;;;;;;
,All in all being a part of any Accenture team is the best thing that I had;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part for me was to learn about the functional aspect of the business apart from the technical part which gave me a greater understanding as to what my job actually meant to everyone;;;;;;;
Would say I enjoyed it while I was there but as far as opportunity goes I had to go;;;;;;;
 Was not disappointed that I left;;;;;;;
 Great employees the typical day was ok;;;;;;;
There is good environment to work , a structured organisation with well build values ;;;;;;;
,Accenture is knows for his core values ;;;;;;;
Great company to work for;;;;;;;
 Excellent Benefits Package;;;;;;;
 Very Admirable culture;;;;;;;
 I was quite impressed with Impact Day (a paid day set aside for employees to participate in community service);;;;;;;
,The Hermitage, TN office needs to run more like a like a business, instead of a social club;;;;;;;
 The inter-office clique does not allow for much individuality;;;;;;;
" The environment is very competitive; to the point of deceitfulness among team members";;;;;;;
,I am personally aware of an incident where an employee's co-worker (who was not even part of the management team), approached them about a very personal matter that had only been discussed in a closed-door discussion with the supervisor;;;;;;;
 Management should keep confidential matters confidential, and not share a person's personal matters with a person's teammate(s);;;;;;;
,It was quite heart-breaking to find out that what I had considered to be an exaggeration by a disgruntled former employee (when someone warned me not to go to this Deloitte office), turned out to be true,;;;;;;;
Microsoft is a fantastic company with great benefits, excellent diversity, and exciting dynamics;;;;;;;
 I would recommend it to anyone;;;;;;;
 Too bad I couldn't bring my job with me to Atlanta!;;;;;;;
Nissan was a great place to work and I enjoyed all my years with Nissan and all the many opportunities that I had with the years I was employed;;;;;;;
 I started out as a technician and worked my way up to an Area Manager and gained alot of knowledge with my time employed here;;;;;;;
 Due to family illness beyond our control I was much needed elsewhere and I am very grateful for all the opportunities that Nissan gave me in the 10 years and 9 months of employment at Nissan;;;;;;;
Market events by posting to online support groups, online calendar listings, Facebook, and other social media outlets;;;;;;;
 Contact press for media coverage;;;;;;;
 Draft and distribute press releases as well as media alerts about events;;;;;;;
Utilize the entire Microsoft suite of applications along with Vocus marketing software;;;;;;;
Manipulated all the data in required model, and knew further about the cash flow state of our clients- all kinds of hedge funds;;;;;;;
 This is a great opportunity to penetrate into the hedge fund industry;;;;;;;
A typical day at work with AXA;;;;;;;
 First thing in the morning after our morning prayer from the bank branch, I start to encode the names of the clients to our system, call then clients for possible closable sale, meeting with the client who agreed to set an appointment with me;;;;;;;
 Report to my manager at the end of the day;;;;;;;
,In this job, I learned to gain self confidence, I am no longer shy to face the clients;;;;;;;
 I learned to act professional;;;;;;;
  I learned all our investment products and bank products that we presented to the clients;;;;;;;
,Management of AXA is very strict because, since they give  us competitive salary and benefits, we need to do our job very well and meet our quotas;;;;;;;
 They are strict but when you do your job very well they always have reward for it;;;;;;;
,The hardest part of the job is, when then clients is not cooperating with me;;;;;;;
 When ever I don't get leads from the banks and not meeting my monthly quotas;;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of then job is when I meet my monthly quota, because I know I have a reward, I have variable pay equivalent to my performance;;;;;;;
 Whenever we have monthly meeting, we checked in to the prestigious hotel and eat delicious foods;;;;;;;
 And get then chance to meet other work mates from different places;;;;;;;
Challenging and inspirational atmosphere driving individuals and teams to achieve their greatest potential, while delivering world class products and services;;;;;;;
The best place to work;;;;;;;

 Worked on research software's, various tax software's etc;;;;;;;
,Team Support, Technology Support was always there, if you have any query or any personal issues respective members were there to help you;;;;;;;
 Working with colleagues was always fun, it was more like win win situation for every co-worker everybody was available at the time of need;;;;;;;
,Most hardest part was the busy season lot of work and long extra hours to complete the deadline but positive side was every senior was available when needed;;;;;;;
 I enjoyed working in Deloitte since I learned a lot and used the same in my daily work routine;;;;;;;
Management turnover is very high;;;;;;;
 Over arching processes tend to stagnate productivity;;;;;;;
 No work life balance (typical week 60+ hours);;;;;;;
 The workload excessive (due primarily to multilayered processes);;;;;;;
 Great people highly dedicated to work (a big plus);;;;;;;
 Prime contractor (Kelly Services) is lacking ethics and provide practically no benefits;;;;;;;
 Organization is weak matrix management style (very silo effect);;;;;;;
The assurance/audit practice, as with most accounting and auditing positions, is not glamorous and can be arduous;;;;;;;
 The work itself can be monotonous until you reach the more experienced senior and manager levels;;;;;;;
,However, the individuals that you work with are some of the most intelligent people you will come across;;;;;;;
 A majority of the management team, from seniors through partners, are willing to go the extra mile and get invested in your career to help you grow as a professional and increase your marketability;;;;;;;
,As is the case with any company, there will be those that are less interested in your advancement and could be considered workaholics;;;;;;;
 Given the high pressure environment, you will run into more of these types than you probably would in another workplace;;;;;;;
,Finally, given how shorthanded the company was during my tenure, there was an unfortunate lack of work/life balance and the compensation does not agree to the level of performance you are expected to deliver;;;;;;;
Deloitte is a great place to start a career and I was lucky enough to get that chance;;;;;;;
,I learnt a lot of things and developed in an overall way;;;;;;;
The people and pay at Deloitte are great;;;;;;;
  The only negative is the work/life balance and the extra meetings and assignments that get piled on;;;;;;;
Deloitte India US office is one of the best places to work;;;;;;;
 The job comes with competitive pay package along with the experience of working with some of the most talented minds int he industry;;;;;;;
 The work culture and management style is better than other organisations in the same domain;;;;;;;
extra long hours, great exposure to leading strategies in the market;;;;;;;
I was masking, sanding and buffing bumpers and I was inspection the bumpers to I also  was a safety representative;;;;;;;
 I had a very good supervisor and I have  learned how to put bumpers on cars;;;;;;;
Highly political;;;;;;;
success is dependent on your manager,Constant re-organization;;;;;;;
I learned to work with different people,I learned typing skills,the hardest part of the job is to meet the deadlines,I enjoy every part of the job am doing I love my job;;;;;;;
Work environment is amazing and people are really good;;;;;;;
,Everyone has a good learning attitude;;;;;;;
work/life balance is not what i want;;;;;;;
 It's a great company to work for;;;;;;;
 It's a good experience;;;;;;;
Accenture is a good place to work;;;;;;;
 Accenture gives a job security;;;;;;;
 The work life balance is also good at Accenture;;;;;;;
 I have learnt a lot at Accenture being my first company and have met with some real good people;;;;;;;
A typical day at work would be opening up lotus notes and other software, researching insurance claims and fix,edit,identify certain require information in order for the insurance claim to be paid;;;;;;;
A good firm for a new joiner where you get good exposure and Learning;;;;;;;
 You have lot of work across all the service lines;;;;;;;
 Management is quite rigid as most of the people have been serving EY for more than 5 -10 years;;;;;;;
 Politics is also big deal here;;;;;;;
its an honest living;;;;;;;
its hard in summer time;;;;;;;
pay is good but the company has way to many rules not pertaning to fda and dot;;;;;;;
Fun environment where everyone is fully focused on the job and is professional;;;;;;;
 Good working hours and receive full support from coaches;;;;;;;

 Non-traditional working hours can be a challenge;;;;;;;

  Always had what I needed to test and the great people in every department;;;;;;;
Deloitte is a great company,In ITS a typical day started with an update from team in India;;;;;;;
,Management was in TN and was moving towards the Consulting model for doing business;;;;;;;
 Even with collaboration tools, the best place to be is at the source, which is either India or TN;;;;;;;
Long Hours,Good Team and well supported co-workers,Good Leadership team;;;;;;;
if something went wrong it was hard to find management and if something was left undone on 3rd shift 1st shift would get the blame for it;;;;;;;
  they were unfair to the workers and treated them badly;;;;;;;
It's a very fun place to be and my co-workers are all very pleasant;;;;;;;
You establish fundamental business acumen and skills vital and important to anyone looking to pursue a career in the corporate world;;;;;;;
It's would be better if you are an FTE here instead to be a vendor;;;;;;;
 That's the reason why I am trying to find a FTE job nearby;;;;;;;
Very warm and friendly atmosphere;;;;;;;
 Working with the latest robotics was very educational and challenging;;;;;;;
 The most undesireable part of the job is the monthly rotations on 12 hr shifts;;;;;;;
 The benefits are very gracious;;;;;;;
 Overall a good place to work;;;;;;;
-CALL CENTER ENVIRONMENT,-I've learned that management only likes #'s dispite that they only tell maybe 1/4 of the story;;;;;;;
,-Customers expect you to do things that we can not do & sometimes do not like our recommendations,-I learned to be patient,,-I've learned to gather information from customers to best assist them with their issues,-I've learned that certain domain registrars do not allow customers to insert certain types of DNS records,-I learned how to utilize tools to better understand issue customers face related to Outlook/Outlook connectivity (i;;;;;;;

though they havent set aside the best times for us to get trained,-Coworkers: some are true Team players while others slander work ethics;;;;;;;
which some come from minor mistakes made by insufficient time to document cases,-The hardest part of the job is helping a customer on something I have little to no experience with & the customer is not willing to make it a joint learning/teaching exprience;;;;;;;
,-THE most enjoyable part of the job is solving a basic issue and the customer uberly prasies us as agents;;;;;;;

Deloitte is a wonderful place to enhance one's skillset and get opportunities to support Fortune 500 clients;;;;;;;
  Opportunities are numerous to grow one's network within the company establishing the base required to advance;;;;;;;
  It is a mostly collaborative environment with some very bright people you will learn a lot from;;;;;;;
  ,It will however challenge your ability to maintain a work life balance;;;;;;;
  This isn't the case on all projects but, more than half of the time you will put in 12+ hours per day though some of that is away from the office tending to emails on your PD;;;;;;;
  ,The importance of your network cannot be understated;;;;;;;
  Take all opportunities to grow it if you're interested in a long career at Deloitte;;;;;;;
Employees are given enough of free time during breaks and other times;;;;;;;
 They are given enough of week-offs;;;;;;;
 When there is a busy season, they are given enough of comfort for them to work effectively;;;;;;;

,Getting to learn new techniques to deal with clients and arranging fun activities on Fridays was the enjoyable part of the job;;;;;;;
Spent a total of 16 years with Microsoft, so have experienced many highs and lows, transitions, management, etc;;;;;;;
,Tremendous opportunities were provided, worked with some of the best and brightest people in the industry;;;;;;;
 Work-life balance was largely contingent on the immediate workgroup;;;;;;;
,Company today is plagued with lack of leadership and the existing stack-ranking/review system is an unhealthy one;;;;;;;
,Lost a lot of the agility and innovation from earlier years;;;;;;;
" Difficult to work ""outside of the box"" which many of us with entrepreneurial spirits need to thrive";;;;;;;
,Enjoyed the vast product/technology set, but also felt the company was trying to be everything to everyone;;;;;;;
 Clearer vision and focus would be welcome;;;;;;;

 no pressure, no worries and you can work as you want;;;;;;;
supervision and management of conference rooms and main dining room,plan organize and coordinate all phases of daily activities including table settings,flower arrangements and purchasing of supplies;;;;;;;

I worked in the tier 3 escalations department for Xbox Live customers;;;;;;;
 My job was very laid back but to the point;;;;;;;
 We had a quota that had to be met daily;;;;;;;
 My supervisor was very knowledgeable;;;;;;;
A typical day I do my job, report on doing my job, show someone how I do my job, then meet about a new job that needs doing;;;;;;;
 I go over my co-worker's work, then research some Google stuff;;;;;;;
 The hardest part is being less interested in making money, and more interested in providing superfluous value for information consumers;;;;;;;
,Co-workers are so unhappy, they speak of company goals--at lunch!;;;;;;;
Typical day at work would be logging into computer/database and oversee all incoming requests by client servers;;;;;;;
 Process all incoming tax returns and ship out to IRS Agency;;;;;;;

Ernst and Young is a work environment where the learning curve is big but the reward is high;;;;;;;
 It is an environment where the ambitious and competitive individuals will shine;;;;;;;
 After going through a big 4 busy season and IPO process (80 hour work weeks), one really learns a lot about what they value in life and what they deem to be a successful career;;;;;;;
 If success to you is being high on the corporate ladder in the accounting field then big 4 will get you there;;;;;;;
 All in all it is a great opportunity and learning experience;;;;;;;
Good place but not great place to work;;;;;;;
 Could not balance my work and personal life due to too much hectic work;;;;;;;
The Trainer i was with was very agitated with me most of the time;;;;;;;
 The group i worked with swore to much, also very rude;;;;;;;
 I was warned  my first day from the manager that this group is not always so nice;;;;;;;
 There was not much chance with that group to stay if they decided they did not like you;;;;;;;
 I liked what i did, some of the people there were so nice too;;;;;;;
  I did find out they started people with a higher pay rate then myself with less experience then i had;;;;;;;
It was my first job out of college;;;;;;;
 That is all i have to say really;;;;;;;
On a day-day basis I would be interacting with clients, following up on  things like pending Annual reviews, interacting with the compliance and Due diligence team to ensure the smoothness of accounts with our clients;;;;;;;
,I have learnt how to interact with clients, co-ordinate with our regional office in Bahrain & also with our Head office in Paris;;;;;;;
 The management included of individuals who strongly believed in the capabilities of their team without having to micro manage - this allowed more room for growth & gave me confidence in my skills;;;;;;;
,The hardest part of the job would be to achieve the targets set with boundaries such as having teams in different countries and time zones (Bahrain & Paris);;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of the job would be the work environment - where people are there to teach & support;;;;;;;
"great training and flexibility, long hours,on job training is a plus; competitive work environment";;;;;;;

Just working on client projects is not enough to succeed in Deloitte;;;;;;;
 The candidate must learn to network, and work on firm/local office initiatives apart from client work;;;;;;;
,Majority of employees are very talented, and there is no time to relax;;;;;;;
 Everyone seeks out for new opportunities within the firm, and so the competition to be rated as top performer is very high;;;;;;;

  The hardest part is that you do not get an opportunity to build relationships with your managers;;;;;;;
learned and improvised skills, updated my skills forte with new capabilities, managing teams and conducting performance audits, cross team functioning and management;;;;;;;
Fun Work place with highly supportive management;;;;;;;
 Not all about the numbers but how I have personally grown and developed myself as a professional and as well as an individual;;;;;;;

 There are plenty of options if you're trying to move up;;;;;;;
 The services group, however, is a bit more difficult to make the move up because the department is much smaller in comparison to other groups such as Consulting or Audit;;;;;;;
 Compensation is highly competitive and they offer great benefits;;;;;;;
 Definitely a great place to work if you're looking for a corporate America lifestyle;;;;;;;
 The work is a bit bland, but manageable;;;;;;;
Great Company makes coming to work fun;;;;;;;
 Only cons is pay, vacation and advancement seems to be base on how long you have been with the company and not how hard you are working;;;;;;;
It was an enjoyable time working for Microsoft's Xbox Support team;;;;;;;
 I gained many skills such as customer call etiquette, professional (but personable) email composition, and time:work load management;;;;;;;
 My co-workers and managers were all very pleasant people;;;;;;;
 The environment was positive and friendly;;;;;;;
" The hardest part of this job was giving the customer a ""hard message"" or basically telling the customer that there is nothing we can do to help due to policy";;;;;;;
 Many customers do no respond well to this no matter how the news is broken;;;;;;;
 However, it was very rewarding hearing from customers we were able to help resolve issues for;;;;;;;
 It's great being recognized for your hard work and perseverance;;;;;;;
Its multicultural environment and its salary package with all the benefits we were granted, made it and excellent place to work;;;;;;;
Microsoft is a challenging and rewarding place to work;;;;;;;
 The company's compensation and benefits are good and ample learning and growth opportunities are available;;;;;;;
 The quality of management is sheerly dependent upon the group, the hardest part of the job is navigating and influencing change in such a large organization, and the most enjoyable part of the job is the company's general willingness to allow its employees to work from outside of the office;;;;;;;
Always busy at work learning new things daily and daily interaction with US counterpart helped me a lot understand their culture and learnt so many new things from them;;;;;;;

Here I learned to combine my language skills with business strategies;;;;;;;
,Apart from language training, I became comfortable with using technology for teaching and training;;;;;;;

Deloitte is a fun place to work;;;;;;;
 Benefits they provide are good and has many firm activities to get involved in;;;;;;;
 The learning opportunities are vast;;;;;;;
 They provide opportunities to enroll for certified trainings from Harvard;;;;;;;
Working at Google was really fun, I never felt it as a hectic job rather, always used to enjoy it;;;;;;;

Great project experience;;;;;;;
 Ability to manage your own career;;;;;;;
 Broad opportunities;;;;;;;
 Great exposure to executives;;;;;;;
If you enjoy consulting  and travel and want to become a partner, this is a good place for you;;;;;;;
There is confusion about the direction work is moving;;;;;;;
 The result is that every product transition leads to a game of musical chairs;;;;;;;
A place where you will learn a lot, but will have to work for it;;;;;;;
 The compensation is comfortable, but like the previous statement, you work for what you get;;;;;;;
 All in all though, probably one of the best places to start a career in accounting;;;;;;;
This is a great place to go after university as you really learn a lot;;;;;;;
 You can try many different clients and industries and you learn about different businesses;;;;;;;
This is one of the best firm to work for in your Life;;;;;;;
 Never miss a chance to work with Deloitte;;;;;;;

 Opportunity to learn is more;;;;;;;
 The culture is Superb;;;;;;;
The team was not set up and there were multiple delays due to which was not satisfied with the work atmosphere in EY GSS, Kerala;;;;;;;
 Hardest part of the job was to wait for the work to arrive;;;;;;;
 Enjoyable part of the job was the location;;;;;;;
Microsoft will made from any employee inside it , productive person and has responsible an down his business also the company will give a chance to the employee to share his opinion  and feedback ;;;;;;;
Accenture is a wonderful company to work for, or so I'm told;;;;;;;
  I have been there since they purchased the company I worked for almost five years ago;;;;;;;
  The healthcare benefits are some of the best you will find, and the work load is enough to keep the overtime hours coming;;;;;;;
  However, there is very little room for advancement, as the term Senior Analyst only goes to those who actually are performing a supervisor/management role, and then team lead goes to the actual manager of the team;;;;;;;
  There will be one manager for a whole department;;;;;;;
  This is not the way it should be, as senior analyst should be given to people that have been there for a certain time, such as three years and have a proven track record;;;;;;;
  Team leads should then be a supervisor and manager should be the person managing the team;;;;;;;
  This would open up a lot more advancement (well short term but why do that when you can keep paying people less than $20/hour;;;;;;;
Not enough work to keep busy with a toxic environment;;;;;;;
  Enjoyed some of the people but the environment is based on $, and not good people;;;;;;;
8 hour work days at Nissan came easy to me, as I am young and quite capable at the job;;;;;;;
 I've learned a lot from the company from my time being there and my hand skills have only increased from the experience;;;;;;;
" My co-workers were all older than me, but I came to fit in well with them; my manager/supervisor was laid back for the most part, but knew when to be serious when it came to work and getting things taken care of";;;;;;;
Like most of the service based companies, life here is based on the Project and Client;;;;;;;
 There is no work life balance;;;;;;;
We will have a opportunity to learn many things but there won't be enough time;;;;;;;
good company but I want to return to my field (oil & gas),day starts with TB Talks,trainings provide on line by internal links (periodically),good managements for safety statistics ,cooperation from co-workers are taking place,work not related to my basic qualifications (Petroleum Field),safety standards have been updated regarding to international & national regulations;;;;;;;
CPA firm had excellent management, my supervisor was an excellent teacher (never worked for a CPA firm before);;;;;;;
Great place to work until you find out to be competitive they are shifting roles offshore;;;;;;;
I have enjoyed 3 years working in Accenture;;;;;;;
 I have learned lot of things in Accenture;;;;;;;
 Worklife balance is very good;;;;;;;
 For fresher this is good company to start up;;;;;;;
Great Place to work and work culture is good;;;;;;;
More flexible in working and mangers are really good people;;;;;;;
 Accenture policies are created in good manner for people ;;;;;;;
If you want to work for a company that has a lot of fascinating and intelligent folks then you want to work for Microsoft;;;;;;;
 Can be a great place to work if you find your niche;;;;;;;
 Benefits are better if you live and work in the Redmond area however the company benefits are good, the work can be rewarding and compensation is pretty good;;;;;;;
,The company is very large so there are many internal places to go should you decide to change jobs;;;;;;;
Varied from kitchen work to behind the bar where I learned responsibilities that may transfer to the business world;;;;;;;
 My experiences taught me a great deal while working here;;;;;;;
- Day starts with team lead assigning the tasks,- Opportunity to explore new things as a beginner,- Checking the 13F filings and comparing the prices;;;;;;;
This was my first job out of college, and I had a great experience;;;;;;;
 The work I was on was challenging, and I felt like I was always learning;;;;;;;
 I was on a couple traveling projects that take a toll on your work/life balance;;;;;;;
Great company with cutting edge solutions;;;;;;;
  Had some great mentors and some aggressive ones, but overall a very good experience;;;;;;;
Great company, challenging work ;;;;;;;
,Office politics and stack ranking needs to be controlled;;;;;;;
A typical day at work would be having a set task lists including reviewing of accounting processes;;;;;;;
 These would be Credit Card Chargeback Reporting, Cash Reconciliation Review, Journal Entry Review;;;;;;;
 I learned a lot about Corporate Accounting and developed a skill set in Accounts Receivables and Cash Management;;;;;;;
 I learned how to research and fix misapplied funds and use what I learned to educate the team;;;;;;;
 My co-workers were incredible, supportive and we would help each other out a lot;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of my job was termination and performance issues involving employees;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of my job was the fast pace, the continual knowledge, new processes and flexibility;;;;;;;
One of the great place to work;;;;;;;
 The only reason I am looking for a change for better career perspective;;;;;;;
Target oriented career, supportive back office, average management, minimal interaction with co workers due to job profile, hyper active seniors, good perks;;;;;;;
I am thankful to Microsoft for giving me the exemptional foundation that enables me to work in any industry and learn any application and become exceptional at testing, support and implementation of applications;;;;;;;
,The cubicle had multiple workstations and the ability to create a mini-network environment unique to the site I was supporting;;;;;;;
,Co-workers were always willing to share information;;;;;;;
,Management supported employees and encouraged growth;;;;;;;
,Learning new products, working with development, writing knowledge base articles and providing customer feedback, along with creating and providing training to fellow collegues and other disciplines were very enjoyable;;;;;;;
During my stint at EY I grew from a freshly qualified CA to a matured professional with a deep understanding of different industries that I have worked for;;;;;;;
 Its a place that offers you so many learning opportunities across various industries where you rub shoulders with the best professionals in the industry;;;;;;;
Employee friendly,Great place to work with,best place,comfortable environment,upgradation of skills,trainings regular,Bets Project Managers and Co workers;;;;;;;
The Training we were initially given was dismal;;;;;;;
 We were pushed out on the floor and literally had to learn and fend for ourselves;;;;;;;
 ,The Managers had never done our Job so we could never ask them for advice, they were only good at barking orders and putting pressure on us to work harder;;;;;;;
 ,The Lady who was running the operation had no idea what she was doing, which did not help matters and was always putting the blame onto every one else to try and cover up her mistakes;;;;;;;
 ,Over all the workers I worked with made the place which made my day enjoyable;;;;;;;
,On a positive note I pushed myself and focused and learnt alot about Microsoft products, Office 365 in perticular;;;;;;;
 I improved my customer Service skills which is good knowledge to have for future Jobs;;;;;;;
Great training and great experiences working on engagements with F500 companies;;;;;;;
,Very competitive at year end reviews;;;;;;;
",Too much emphasis on ""extracurricular"" Firm Activities rather than engagement performance";;;;;;;
I did learn everything about Microsoft licensing;;;;;;;
 Very interesting,I used to call clients to make a review of their licenses,Really good atmosphere at work,Managers were so professionals;;;;;;;
If you want to work for management that has favorites, is dishonest and uneducated on today's computer technology, then you found the right place to work;;;;;;;
 If you can deal with the poor management then good for you, but the bullying by other employees might deter you from wanting to work there;;;;;;;
 Plenty of nice people, but the negative, nasty people with the strong personalities will make you wonder if you are back in high school;;;;;;;
 If you are tough and can take it then just be ware that this part of the company is being sold off;;;;;;;
 At least in high school you are guaranteed 4 years;;;;;;;
 Fireman's Fund, not so much!;;;;;;;
Great work environment;;;;;;;
 Learnt to interact with people from various cultural background;;;;;;;
 Facilities and services were good and the co-workers were very helpful;;;;;;;
I would say that Accenture is a very good organization provided one can bargain at the time of employment ;;;;;;;
 Apart from that there are various divisions like IO and AO which one should be careful about since it might demarcate their career graph;;;;;;;
 In IO there is no scope for technical improvement;;;;;;;
 Overall it is a nice organization ;;;;;;;
This job needs a lot of dedication and hard work relentlessly;;;;;;;
A great organization to be a part of;;;;;;;
 The opportunities are there to be taken, experiences at EY are what the inividual chooses to make of them;;;;;;;
It was a great learning for me in the company, pertaining to administrative skills, the reason why i learnt these things is because of my interest and the overwhelming support which was provided to me by my superiors;;;;;;;
,            Their great leadership will be remembered for a longer period of time in my heart, the environment which we got in  the company is incredible;;;;;;;
 We used to have lot of interaction with the managers, senior managers etc, so it is very difficult for me to forget  those days;;;;;;;
 The personality development sessions helped us a lot in   interacting with people professionally;;;;;;;
,           When it comes to learning, the learning is a part of life and it cannot be stopped at any cost;;;;;;;
 We should be open to learning and we should create the awareness in the minds of the people about the learning and i personally believe that in order to become extraordinary in life continuous efforts are needed;;;;;;;
Our values,Who we are,People who demonstrate integrity, respect, and teaming;;;;;;;
,People with energy, enthusiasm, and the courage to lead;;;;;;;

An exciting place to work that is changing constantly and innovating;;;;;;;
 Going through a cultural change for the positive;;;;;;;
 Opportunity to learn and grow and work in different parts of the company;;;;;;;
 Very diverse and multi-national workforce;;;;;;;
Awful culture, awful environment, very poor compensation;;;;;;;
Excellent leadership team who drives the production environment with fun and motivation, concentration of motivation factor is excellent in Accenture;;;;;;;
Typical day was to attend meetings in the morning;;;;;;;
,Followed by doing day-to-day calculations;;;;;;;
,Creating powerpoint;;;;;;;
,Presenting powerpoint to management;;;;;;;
My team is good;;;;;;;
 I have  learned so many thing hear;;;;;;;
 Hear i like cab facility n food;;;;;;;
In my team we r just like a family;;;;;;;
 Hear i am enjoying like home;;;;;;;
Challenging/dynamic environment;;;;;;;
 Requires strong collaboration and internal influencing skills;;;;;;;
 Fast paced, demanding environment in which highly adaptive work style is valued;;;;;;;
Its no wonder Microsoft have such a good name;;;;;;;
 Their people are smart and work hard;;;;;;;
 They have a fantastic working environment and treat each employee with the utmost respect;;;;;;;
I have learned a lot from seniors and from management like how to work in corporate office  ;;;;;;;
and how to behave others in corporate office;;;;;;;
I've learned tons from this company;;;;;;;
 Very good place to work if you're looking to grow professionally;;;;;;;
I have a learned alot while working as both in the Human Resource and Resource management area at Deloitte;;;;;;;
 I currently perform a dual role so play different hats;;;;;;;
 I have great visability with leadership and work closely over 300 resources on a daily basis;;;;;;;
 I help manage a service line;;;;;;;
 I have worked in all aspects of HR and I feel I have a breath of knowledge in the HR area;;;;;;;
 I have many years of experience;;;;;;;
 I have a wide range of analytical skills as well as strategic skills;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of my job is to keep up with the email traffic and ensure I get back to each and every employee, the most enjoyable is helping my resources through any issues they have and seeing them be successful at the company;;;;;;;
 I love working on the Human Resources area as it exposes me to so many different types of people at so many different types of levels;;;;;;;
Working at Accenture is fun  but  work load is uneven and could be too much for 1 day and there could be nothing much to do for some days;;;;;;;
Management and co-workers are supportive and very nice to get along with;;;;;;;
,Would love to work again with the company;;;;;;;
They have many nice and filthy rich projects;;;;;;;
Salary is low;;;;;;;
 but the work quality and work culture is good;;;;;;;
 yes good opportunities to learn but no bonus;;;;;;;
Allowed me to have a good career start;;;;;;;
 The program experience enable me to learn technical skill quickly and be able to play a leadership role after 2 years of working;;;;;;;
It's a fantastic workplace;;;;;;;
  Great group of smart people and a very relaxed work environment;;;;;;;
  However, as with most large companies, there are plenty of politics and direction becomes muddied;;;;;;;
I love the fact that they take the time to properly train the new employees;;;;;;;
,they have a lot of support and tools to get you through the training and succeed in your work;;;;;;;
I engaged in this job after I acquired my accounting degree;;;;;;;
,This is E&Y's Chinese head office which allocated in the centre of China's capital city-- Beijing;;;;;;;
,From the time of being an auditing apprentice, I found auditors in Chinese is extremely busy;;;;;;;
 But influenced by E&Y's enterprise culture, everyone in the team enjoy the daily work, and the task allocation and its time management make them feel their job is meaningful;;;;;;;
,The three month work in E&Y provide me a window to international accounting firms, and which enhanced my willing to be an export in this career;;;;;;;
Great company, great training, great facilities;;;;;;;
 The position was commission based so not ideal for long term sustainability;;;;;;;
working as an intern at microsoft was always fun, peers were every supportive;;;;;;;
 The training sessions were always so informative;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job was to create apps over night and presenting it to boss on office 360;;;;;;;
 The best part was winning the windows hackathon (2012) in our region karachi;;;;;;;
EY is the best place for a young professional to learn and taking large responsibilities;;;;;;;
 Great opportunity of personal growth;;;;;;;
I was there on a temporary basis from May to December 2012;;;;;;;
 Very enjoyable place to work in and nice co-workers in general;;;;;;;
A typical day would start by reviewing the emails and actions to be done accordingly followed by a lot of learning extra and also from the mistakes;;;;;;;
A good place to start your career, but easy to get lost in org changes, company politics, and inhuman laddering practices;;;;;;;
,Compensation increases not comparable with industry $$$$ elsewhere;;;;;;;
OK to work with, timimg is an issue;;;;;;;
 Otherwise good company to work with;;;;;;;

 Enjoying part of the job is the recognition you get when you achieve success and the incentives that comes with it;;;;;;;

Deloitte is a learning journey where you need to keep on your toes all the time in terms of latest technology as well as in terms of other consulting skills;;;;;;;
 Deloitte gave me a lot of opportunity to learn and grow;;;;;;;
Opening of day took observation of areas of the office that needed my attention;;;;;;;
 Fulfilled regular duties and assignments;;;;;;;
,Learned about dealing with vendors an corporate purchasing;;;;;;;
,Our management team was great and allowed the staff to make the office and efficient and productive as possible;;;;;;;
,My co-workers were very good to work with and provided support to others as needed;;;;;;;
,There were really no hard parts to the job;;;;;;;
,Most enjoyable part of the job was working and learning from the Tech department on lunch of after work which led me to pursue a tech option as a career;;;;;;;
I found my peers to be of the utmost intelligent, hardworking, full of integrity people I know;;;;;;;
 I just don't comprehend as to why they have talent resource people, when you are the one who is suppose to find projects to work on? Is it not enough to do my job and then have to do their job of networking with Partners, Principals and Directors to find another project? Other than this it's a great company to work for;;;;;;;
I've heard and seen many companies use the term work/life balance but only have I witnessed it here at Google;;;;;;;
 With the proper design and flexibility, they have managed to create an atmosphere of higher learning and constant evolution in the DRIVE to come to work;;;;;;;
 ,It's not the benefits and pay (although that always helps) that make working here so great, its the feeling of wanting to come to work to achieve more;;;;;;;
 I've yet to encounter a single person who grips or complains about management or peers here;;;;;;;
 The collaboration and effort I see in the faces of co-workers and peers is unlike any place I've seen to date;;;;;;;
,I'd have to say that my most challenging and fulfilling part of my job as a Hardware Test Technician, is that fact that there is ALWAYS something for me to improve on and I have the freedom and flexibility to choose;;;;;;;
Great place to work, friendly people making work a pleasure;;;;;;;
the company has a good reputation but salaries and career advancement are not as good as in other consulting companies;;;;;;;
A great place to learn and grow,Get to work in different projects;;;;;;;
 Most work is based on client requirement and translating them to a system;;;;;;;
gained new professional friends,team working,great managers,work shops,conferences;;;;;;;
I was hired for a project that ended;;;;;;;
 During my tenure at BNP, I learned about many different products which I did not have experience with;;;;;;;
 Overall Great Experience for ME!;;;;;;;
MS is an awesome workplace;;;;;;;
 Supportive management and co-workers;;;;;;;
 The work-life balance is great;;;;;;;
 Enormous opportunity to you to grow in your career;;;;;;;
typical office job you go in start your assignment get the job done as fast as you can with quailty,the management is very professional the co workers can be the best depending on what type of personality you like;;;;;;;
I would say the hardest part of the job is trying to get your assignment done on time;;;;;;;
Microsoft is a fast and constantly evolving organization;;;;;;;
 A typical day for me at work involves working on various reports and forming analysis on data points for different business groups;;;;;;;
 The best part of my job is it allows me to play with numbers and analyze data which is what interests me and keeps me moving;;;;;;;
No Comments on management and co-workers;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part was travel;;;;;;;
 Hardest part of the job was managers are not open to accept new innovative solutions;;;;;;;
Day starts around 10 AM and all working days are as usual, sometimes filled with tension and at times fun at work place;;;;;;;
 I love interacting with people, so that makes workplace quite interesting for me;;;;;;;
 I have found everyone around me friendly and helpful;;;;;;;
 My current job demands work at night but I am fine and flexible with that as it is not on an on-going basis;;;;;;;
 Hardest part is that I do not find any relation to what I have learnt in Economics;;;;;;;
 I enjoy my job as it includes a lot of responsibilities and independent work;;;;;;;
It is indeed a great place to work;;;;;;;
 Diversity program in Accenture is one of the best initiative;;;;;;;
 Very much client centric;;;;;;;
This experience was valuable because I was able to work in a big company under valuable guidence of experienced professionals;;;;;;;
I attended the meeting for the first time in my carrer within the departments and with the clients;;;;;;;
I was like a never ending learning experience for me;;;;;;;
The co workers and management encouraged me and helped me with whatever difficulties I faced;;;;;;;
The hardest part was moulding myself to this new environment;;;;;;;
But it helped me eventually to which ever place i went;;;;;;;
The office hours were from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM which usually extended till 6:00PM;;;;;;;
We worked in a cross-cultural team, which members come from 7 different countries, and within the virtual environment, it is quite challenging for us to set a clear schedule to work towards the same goal;;;;;;;
 As time goes on, we managed to cooperate well in this environment and foster a unique team spirit;;;;;;;
I was  a summer intern in Deloitte for a period of 2 months;;;;;;;
 The management is very friendly and helps in out in every way possible;;;;;;;
LLEGAR 8 DE LA MAÃ‘ANA A JUTA DE VENTAS Y AL TERMINO DE ESTA, REALIZAR LAS ACTIVIDADES QUE TENGAS EN EL DIA;;;;;;;
Working at Deloitte was an experience I will always cherish;;;;;;;
 ,Most of the day was spent working on Excel sheets - preparing reports, reviewing reports and e-mailing reports;;;;;;;
,Learning:,Interaction with my peers,The value of professionalism,Mail Etiquette,Creating a Social Impact ,The hardest part of the job was getting the excel reports accurate without any error which included many checks :),The  most enjoyable part of the job was the fun interaction with my colleagues everyday and the culture that supported the philosophy that - 'as long as your work is done, we are fine';;;;;;;
Microsoft work very hard to maintain the existing software by fixing bugs;;;;;;;
 They have good system of bug reviews and fixes;;;;;;;
Great working in this company;;;;;;;
 Very supportive friends, colleagues and the team and management;;;;;;;

 I enjoyed working in this place;;;;;;;

Part of multidisciplinary team, bringing diverse perspectives to every challenge;;;;;;;
 Provides the opportunity to build my skills in numerous competencies and industries;;;;;;;
I loved working here;;;;;;;
 The colleagues and the company are great;;;;;;;
 YIu receive many benefits;;;;;;;
 We worked with targets;;;;;;;
 We had to optimize a certain amount of accounts per month;;;;;;;
 The target was divided into two aspects;;;;;;;
 A typical week: optimize 4 accounts per day, answering emails, preparation, administration of the workflow and checking the call and workflow quality of other colleagues;;;;;;;
 Also you did some cold calling for making the appointments with the customer;;;;;;;
 Once per month I provided a training on a certain topic;;;;;;;
 The work itself was a lot of routine;;;;;;;
 Since every customer has its own story and goals, the work was fun;;;;;;;
 You really helped customers optimizing their marketing on Google and with that expanding their business;;;;;;;
 That is really fulfilling;;;;;;;
working in Infosys for Microsoft Partners was a great experience;;;;;;;
 Very good working enviornment;;;;;;;
 Improved a lot of communication skills, and how to tackle with clients and escalations;;;;;;;
Working with Accenture was truly a pleasure, mainly because the value it gives to their employees;;;;;;;
 Rewarding and recognition was brilliant;;;;;;;
 It helps in keeping employees motivated towards performing well, and consequently towards the organisation;;;;;;;
After I had my baby boy I was offered a redundant package and like a few of us that were offered this package and took It, I did take the package as well;;;;;;;
 EY is a great pace to be, they offer diversity and share culture;;;;;;;
Was treated with respect and I enjoyed my job thoroughly;;;;;;;
 Management team was great and always took care of their employees;;;;;;;
I learned so much from that company, hated to leave;;;;;;;
  The people there all want to get ahead but also support their teams;;;;;;;
  The recognize they're stronger as a unit;;;;;;;
Around the clock checks on the website being managed;;;;;;;
 Managing ad placements, new ads, website management, customer service, and helping daily website visitors;;;;;;;
Coming right out of Campus, Accenture helped me very smoothly move into the cooperate like;;;;;;;
 Working with Accenture was a good experience and has helped me grow professionally to a new height;;;;;;;
People are very friendly, the staff and management;;;;;;;
 I've never seen a company like that;;;;;;;
 They make everyone feel welcomed;;;;;;;
Great place to start a career in order to learn more about industries and your self;;;;;;;
 Exposure to different industries and work allows for learning opportunities;;;;;;;
Xbox warranty service;;;;;;;
,out-bound call center,tools issues;;;;;;;
Learned a lot about HR activities;;;;;;;
,Management always provides feedback for the work done;;;;;;;
,Very knowledgeable & helpful co-workers;;;;;;;
,The hardest part was to cope up with the deadlines everyday;;;;;;;
,The enjoyable part was the fun activities & parties organised every quarter;;;;;;;
If not at your client's office testing, in the office drafting the reports based on the test results;;;;;;;
  It is a small office with only five employees;;;;;;;
  Learned to work with different kind of people and different kind of environment;;;;;;;
  Built my interpersonal and communication skills;;;;;;;
  Focus so much on time management was very important;;;;;;;
  Helpful and considerate co-workers;;;;;;;
  The hardest part of the job is to get your client to agree with your findings;;;;;;;
  The most enjoyable part of the job is going from one industry to another (auditing of different industries), meeting new people and networking;;;;;;;
The HR policies are very good for employees;;;;;;;
 Unfortunately, the company managers lacks of communication skills and the work is extremely siloed;;;;;;;
 Needs more cross-integration;;;;;;;
There are a lot of smart and talented people working in Microsoft;;;;;;;
  ,However, the culture and atmosphere is not good;;;;;;;
  Depending on the team and manager you get, ,it can turn from a dream company to a nightmare;;;;;;;
  Constant re-orgs, managers' shifting and ,political abuse, due to the recent RIF and too much middle layer managers;;;;;;;
,I wouldn't recommend this company to a young and ambitious engineer;;;;;;;
  But if you can not get into,another big tech company,  Microsoft is still a brand name from which you can build you resume and learn some ,of the cool technologies;;;;;;;
we had well culture at  which motivates to work hardly and fully job security their was no scar of loosing job especially for women employees more prior security was their and it was much safety;;;;;;;
Accenture is a big brand, it is good to start your career,Management depends on the project you are working in;;;;;;;
 Worked with the best and worst management;;;;;;;
Fast paced environment;;;;;;;
 Can learn a lot from the company;;;;;;;
 The client included the out sourced employees in many activities;;;;;;;
It is fun to work with a diverse goup of people;;;;;;;
 The maangement was friendly;;;;;;;
 Also the work was interesting as I was working on capital markets;;;;;;;
I worked across numerous countries and enjoyed the opportunity at Accenture;;;;;;;
  The management team was very supportive but did not micromanage;;;;;;;
  Loved the culture of the company;;;;;;;
Egypt COE is a one man show that doesnt fall under any global Microsoft policies,No work life balance;;;;;;;
A great company to work for! They took me from a basement coder to an Engineer to a software architect;;;;;;;
 There are endless opportunities with Accenture for you to discoverer who you are;;;;;;;
Microsoft retail is a great place to work if you are looking to really make a name for yourself in retail;;;;;;;
  I many ways, it is just like another retail job but things are handled considerably better than other retailers;;;;;;;
  Communication is good;;;;;;;
  Benefits are excellent;;;;;;;
  Pay is fair;;;;;;;
  The consistency of goals makes for some stress as targets are always moving but if you enjoy new situations and reacting accordingly, it's nice;;;;;;;
  Middle management, like any retailer, is always the crutch;;;;;;;
  There is always a disconnect between the people running the show, and when objectives arrive at your store;;;;;;;
  There was always a disconnect too with Microsoft as a whole;;;;;;;
  What we did in retail seemed insignificant when compared to the greater company;;;;;;;
  I loved my coworkers;;;;;;;
  I loved my store;;;;;;;
  I was expecting more but at the end of the day, it is still retail;;;;;;;
It can be difficult to navigate the company and culture if you do not have prior consulting experience;;;;;;;
Extremely professional lead company;;;;;;;
,Culture of over-achievement;;;;;;;
,Great customer environment;;;;;;;
,Solution Innovators, passion for technology;;;;;;;
,Great colleagues;;;;;;;

Log into multiple systems, check emails, ticket resolution system, verify software updates;;;;;;;
 send out general status of upcoming updates and provide install counts to mgmnt;;;;;;;
 Most difficult part of the job was dealing with user frustration over failed software update;;;;;;;
 Most enjoyable part was calming them down and resolving their issues successfully;;;;;;;
"Since the main focus was on consulting, the ""Outsourcing"" employees like me were at their mercy regarding advancement and job security";;;;;;;
,We did have a week long afternoon shift every 4 weeks which was not good for the circadian rhythm, and for me was the hardest part of the job;;;;;;;
,Since we were AOG purchasers we were always working at a faster pace, which is normal for me;;;;;;;
The friendly environment certainly encourage productivity and creativity in us;;;;;;;
,Hardest part of the job is the short breaks and sometimes we had to work in weekends;;;;;;;
,Most enjoyable part were the friendly co-workers and open desk policy which helped in fair judgment;;;;;;;
I had the best first job experience;;;;;;;
 I was given the freedom to work the way I want, the knowledge provided by my managers and the support of my senior colleagues helped me gain valuable insight in the processes;;;;;;;
New challenges;;;;;;;
,Learning opportunities;;;;;;;
,Internal techincal tranning;;;;;;;
If you want to grow at Microsoft, you will have to be ready to burn yourself;;;;;;;
A typical day at work involved staying on top of the group heads calendars;;;;;;;
 Giving reminders about important meetings, conferences and industry events;;;;;;;
 Working on the trading floor provided a great opportunity to learn quickly and organically;;;;;;;
,My co-workers were the best part of my day;;;;;;;
Anyone would love working with Accenture ;;;;;;;
It is one of the biggest BPO in the world;;;;;;;
,The great thing i like about the company is their core policy respect to individuals;;;;;;;
A typical day at work starts with greeting possibly everyone on the office floor with a cup of hot coffee in hand;;;;;;;
,Then back to my desk, checking my mails and getting right back to work;;;;;;;
People at this company are ready to succeed;;;;;;;
  As a result, the teams can be very competitive, but this means that every day you'll accomplish something;;;;;;;
Helpful Team Manger,Rewarded for my hard work and dedication,Provided timely training and required certifications,All this helped in my career growth and accomplishments;;;;;;;
Currently, I am in charge of assessing the counterparty/credit risks attached to the portfolio by reviewing/analysing the counterparty's strategy, performance and infrastructure (risk and operations);;;;;;;
,As one of my colleague is in maternity leave, and the other colleague just left the company, I am in charge of all daily activities and report directly to the manager;;;;;;;
 Therefore, it is not always easy to finish all work and this oblige me to stay later every evening;;;;;;;
 I can learn more from my manager as I am alone;;;;;;;
,As I am rigorous, able towork quickly I am able to submit all prioritized file at the deadline;;;;;;;
What's there to review, its Deloitte with a worldwide reputation!;;;;;;;
Associate level 5 :supported multiple modules ;;;;;;;
,Supported multiple clients;;;;;;;
,Most of he clients were mining industry ;;;;;;;
There's no denying E&Y's impact on your resume;;;;;;;
 If you can handle the long hours and (generally) extremely boring and tedious work, you can make a great career for yourself or, at a minimum, add a strong bullet to your resume;;;;;;;
,Work hours can be long but the firm can also be very flexible when you need time off or have personal needs to work out;;;;;;;
 The work is often extremely repetative at the lower levels and the job becomes more of a sales position as you increase in rank;;;;;;;
 Pay is average (although EY likes to make you think otherwise);;;;;;;
,Great place to start your career and as long as you can handle traveling and the stress of not knowing where you'll physically be from week to week, you'll be glad you did;;;;;;;
 Definitely not for me, but there are plenty of people who would be a great fit here;;;;;;;
Accenture's most valuable asset is it's people and they are amazing;;;;;;;
 In my 8 years I have worked with the most intelligent, hard-working, interesting people one could hope for;;;;;;;
 Accenture does fantastic work in a challenging environment;;;;;;;
 The opportunities for learning, growth, and advancement are abundant and I have been continuously impressed with support I've received through the many challenges that have arisen;;;;;;;
A typical day at work is handling multiple accounts every day dealing with different personalaties and their business needs;;;;;;;
 I have learned to be very patient and listen before speaking always helps;;;;;;;
 Often times my customer's just want to vent on an issue that wasn't handled right instead of fixing it right away;;;;;;;
 My co-workers were all great when I needed help or coverage they were always ready to help out;;;;;;;
" The hardest part of the job is having the word ""Technical"" as part of my title but yet I did not have deep technical expertise";;;;;;;
 but I was able to guide them to the right resource when needed;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to visit different work sites and not having to go to the office every day and sit in a cubicle;;;;;;;
Create short films, manage large groups of people to collaborate ideas, write scripts, film and direct each video;;;;;;;
 My films have generated over 25 million views;;;;;;;
Most managers stress work/life balance and want to see the people on their teams succeed on an individual as well as team level;;;;;;;
 When you work for one of them Microsoft is a great place to be;;;;;;;
 Sadly there are still too many managers who are just interested in furthering their own careers and who are sometimes just incompetent, and their opinion of you can adversely affect your career for years;;;;;;;
 Try to connect with people who work for the team you're interviewing with to get an honest assessment of what kind of manager you'll be working for;;;;;;;
i learned so many things with this company likes SDTM programming , working on SAS ,handling many tasks,taking knowledge sharing session with co-workers, helping each other within team and achieving the target on right time;;;;;;;
,the hardest part of job is 'when we don't meet the target for particular studies',working on the studies is most enjoyable part of the job;;;;;;;

I enjoyed working at Nissan in Canton, MS but there were a lot of key events that deterred me from staying with the company;;;;;;;
  Actually, I would not recommend any sane person to pursue a job there;;;;;;;
i've learned a lot in this company since we do the basic technical stuffs and it's really out of my field but learned a lot in a short span of time;;;;;;;
 Also, I've encountered a lot personalities and dealt with them  well;;;;;;;
Working in Microsoft is a wonderful experience;;;;;;;
 Learnt Team Handling, effective communication, Team work;;;;;;;
 Everyday was part of learning and there was always something new to learn;;;;;;;

 Must customers we constant repeat and I got to know them well and was a joy to assist them and have conversations while they waited for their vehicles;;;;;;;

APRENDI EL VALOR DE LA RESPONSABILIDAD Y EFISIENCIA QUE SE DEBE TENER PARA TENER UN BUEN DESEMPEÃ‘O LABORAL;;;;;;;
I had a nice Team to work with, undoubtedly the project in which i was working was pretty complex and it had a back to back release which gave us a tough time as the timelines that we received was short as part of the knowledge time required to understand the system but we were able to achieve the targets;;;;;;;
Having a wonderful experience of nonvoice bpo in various domains & knowledge of operation reports like deck report & handling & answering client calls eventhough it is a non voice & trainings like commercial lending operations, etc;;;;;;;
If you want to impact people using technology in their lives and work, literally everywhere in the world, Microsoft is the best place to be;;;;;;;
 If you are entrepreneurial, this is a spirit that jives with the future direction of the company but current engineering culture is still figuring out how to embrace this spirit given the need to maintain and bring forward legacy products and processes;;;;;;;
 Microsoft is a work in progress, yet again;;;;;;;
,A day in the life depends on what your role is, and many of us wear many hats;;;;;;;
 Expect to exchange opinions and take feedback, sometimes harshly delivered, on a regular basis;;;;;;;
 When you work on something important, which is most everything, there are always others who care deeply about getting it right and getting it out on time;;;;;;;
,If you are lucky enough to interact with customers on a regular basis, expect to spend time trying to get their voices heard;;;;;;;
 This is more and more a value in the company and everyone will spend time on forums like UserVoice, Reddit, and other forums for direct customer and partner contact;;;;;;;
,Some degree of politics and many layers of management in this huge company still make it hard to move and respond quickly even though there is a strong push towards One Microsoft;;;;;;;
 Top leadership at the company has the right ideas, some of the engineering leaders are better at technology, others better at product vision, some care a lot about people, some don't do as well in any of the above categories;;;;;;;
,The benefits are amazing and the opportunities for learning endless;;;;;;;
 You can work on almost any kind of product and technology in;;;;;;;

 The most enjoyable was the fast paced environment and getting to know a lot of different cultures and people;;;;;;;

I learned the ethics working at such a competitive environment and modified myself from a normal graduate to a professional in short span of time by enjoying the work as well as achieving the reputation as an individual and for the company;;;;;;;
It was a great opportunity to work for a well known company that had a lot of great projects where i learned a lot and the very high competition pushed me to work harder and try to move up in the company;;;;;;;
Good growth opportunities,Challenging work environment,Exposure to clients;;;;;;;
Good Team players in and around,Leaders support,Working In Deloitte would be an awesome experience for anyone;;;;;;;
,can learn communication skills;;;;;;;
 leadership qualities etc;;;;;;;
AGCS was a very nice place to work;;;;;;;
 Co-workers made it a family type atmosphere;;;;;;;

Core business services you will find people who are either passionate about their job and jump different levels wherever the door opens or those who are comfortable in their job;;;;;;;
 It is not the 'up or out' motto that you see from the client serving side;;;;;;;
 Diversity & Inclusiveness is very strong at EY yet in some groups it is lacking in the 'people first' environment;;;;;;;
 Too many priorities at task and some upper management is becoming 'JP Morgan' with uncertainty which IT group is going to Alpharetta;;;;;;;
 ,EY has great benefits and is focused in helping employees developing their career through training;;;;;;;
 The offices are moving to become more agile which has it's plus and minuses;;;;;;;
 ,All around it truly is a great company but should reinvest in the IT infrastructure to attract the millennials and retain talent;;;;;;;
 When you know the right people, they will be your sponsor in bettering your career and helping their own career;;;;;;;

A typical day at work would consist of daily sales of Xbox and Surface;;;;;;;
 Customers would come to the store and ask questions about our products or would need help updating their OS on either Surfaces, PC's, Xbox One or Windows Phones;;;;;;;
 I learned about time management and a lot of leadership;;;;;;;
 By making sure the store stays on top with sales or promotions I would email the team making sure we stay up to par and making sure we give the right information to our customers;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job could be having slow traffic at our location;;;;;;;
 Slow traffic could usually occur during the beginning of the week but by having limited customers we would do whatever it takes to get the sale as well as having attachments;;;;;;;
 Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers about the Xbox One;;;;;;;
 Being able to show customers the greatness of the Xbox One and showing them how efficient it can be for our customers really excite me;;;;;;;

As translation occupied the majority of my work time, I had little chance to talk to people;;;;;;;
  Sometimes I had to do lots of overtime due to excessive amount of translation required;;;;;;;
  I liked translation but preferred doing more interpretation;;;;;;;
  One good thing was I learned a lot about certain aspects of non-life insurance business through all those translation works which I could take advantage of in later years of my career;;;;;;;
There is very good scope for CA's but if you are not a professional you don't even have a 20% growth;;;;;;;

 As the general notion and perception impacts on the general function of an organisation;;;;;;;

This is a very dynamic environment with endless opportunities;;;;;;;
  It is encouraged to stay current in which training is a part of their culture;;;;;;;
  The colleagues are top notch and they share information to help other succeed and grow;;;;;;;
  Leadership is the best I have experienced;;;;;;;
  All are highly skilled, and are serious about their open door policy;;;;;;;
If you have the personality to handle the stress, hours and travel, it's a great company to work for!,Negotiate salary because it wont change much for several years;;;;;;;

 This job is a great introduction into the world of Software QA, if that is your passion, and I encourage anyone to apply for this job that you won't forget;;;;;;;
As a first job, I am completely satisfied with my position;;;;;;;
 A typical day would be to search for solutions to problems on the system, correct to those problems;;;;;;;
 If any, I will also correct the case on error;;;;;;;
Being an Accenture employee, every single day is very productive;;;;;;;
 You've learned different ideas and new technologies everyday;;;;;;;
 Management were very approachable and also the co-employees;;;;;;;

This is a great place for someone who is just starting out in their career;;;;;;;
 I have learned a lot about time management, getting things done on time, by the deadline and within budget;;;;;;;
 The project management skills learned in this company are invaluable;;;;;;;
 The price you pay however is that you have to get used to people with different work styles, and learn to sacrifice your personal life for the job;;;;;;;
 Because of the competitive nature of the business, sometimes you might end up feeling on your own in identifying solutions;;;;;;;
Helped in assisted sales and training of the Microsoft Xbox Kinect though out Best Buy and Walmart store locations;;;;;;;

Challenge was creating a unified working environment in a muti-cultural environment;;;;;;;

I like working with people and most of the employee that I work with are very helpful;;;;;;;
I had the opportunity to interface with many smart people working on the latest in NLP, Search Algorithms, Machine Learning, and improving overall search relevancy;;;;;;;
 The facilities were nice and I had the luxury of working from anywhere;;;;;;;
 I felt sometimes that progress was slow due to bureaucracy;;;;;;;
 The hardest part was the late night hours because of having to work with overseas teams;;;;;;;
 I enjoyed more than anything interacting with people;;;;;;;
Culture is their number 1 priority and it's shown in the caliber of staff they bring on;;;;;;;
repair and maintenance of liquified gas equipement daily;;;;;;;
 Manufacture bottle filling stations as required by production needs;;;;;;;
Close involvement with operators for their production and safety needs;;;;;;;
 Hardest part was doing preventative maintenance around production requirements;;;;;;;
The nature of the auto sales business needs alot of help;;;;;;;
  The sales personal work too many hours for the money the earn;;;;;;;
  They have to pay to work at most dealerships,,, If you don't sell a car you get paid a draw check;;;;;;;
 which you have to pay back when you do sell a car;;;;;;;
,From my experience all aspects of a car deal is to make as much money as you possibly can;;;;;;;
  Which is legal but morally wrong;;;;;;;
  The speak of a fair deal;;;;;;;
 but it's just one hidden lie;;;;;;;
Very fast paced environment;;;;;;;

Good experience to work in Accenture;;;;;;;

â€¢a typical day at work,I was able to handle the entire work load by myself with no issues;;;;;;;
 This network was static even though it was call center size;;;;;;;
 The typical day would be, for example, a Cisco 2950 switch would go down impacting everyone attached or a user would lose access to the network;;;;;;;
,â€¢what you learned,I learned more about being a contractor then anything else because I only held the position for 10 months;;;;;;;
 I had come from a dynamic and complex network with Charter Communications, the Nissan network consisted of only 5 access layer switches;;;;;;;
,â€¢management,I was a contractor so it was pretty cut in dry;;;;;;;
 I had some interaction with my manager but due to the fact that I was a contractor he would just give me my workload via email everyday;;;;;;;
,â€¢your co-workers,Many of the team in the IT department had been there for multiple years and the group had a lot of organizational knowledge;;;;;;;
 This made it so easy for me to engage any of the players needed from management if switches started going down;;;;;;;
,â€¢the hardest part of the job,I was a contractor and had never held a contracting position before;;;;;;;
 So I was surprised at how contractors get treated;;;;;;;
 That was probably the hardest thing to realize;;;;;;;
for the most part regardless of company contractors will be treated like an outsider;;;;;;;
,â€¢the most enjoyable part of the job,Fixing outages when people need help;;;;;;;
 I have no greater satisfaction than when I've helped someone, successfully, who were in need of help;;;;;;;
I liked working with Accenture;;;;;;;
Working environment here is excellent;;;;;;;
 The Management is very cooperative;;;;;;;
 Also I got opportunity to work on multiple technologies including TIBCO Products and IBM MQ/MB;;;;;;;
Work starts from 10 and continues till late in night (many times till 9-10 PM) Skills involved with OJT, many features of recently launched software from Microsoft;;;;;;;
 Poor management with not so wide view and analytical skills of market they were trying to penetrate;;;;;;;
 Bad image of company among dealers and distributors;;;;;;;
 Not a lot of enjoyable time was spent with the employer;;;;;;;
It seems there are new people all the time;;;;;;;
 Pay was good, there was some sort of flexibility but not much work-life balance;;;;;;;
Great management and fun work place;;;;;;;
 challenging work environment;;;;;;;
I was hired with a group of 30+ people to provide Googles Play Store with Technical/ Product Ordering Support;;;;;;;
 My time with Randstaff Staffing as a temporary worker was short lived, as Google decided to cut the project and lay us off a week later;;;;;;;
 Despite the temporary set back, I was fortunate to be hired among a pool of Thousands of applicants and I consider that an accomplishment in and of itself;;;;;;;
 I was grateful for my time at Google and LOVED the micro kitchen with unlimited snack privilages;;;;;;;
An easy 9 hour of exhaustive learning;;;;;;;
 Learned soft skills, java, mainframe technologies;;;;;;;
 Was fun to work here;;;;;;;
 The friday events were peppy;;;;;;;
My day always started at 8:30 PM and ended at 5:30 AM;;;;;;;
 I learned to be punctual all the time because of the workload that was being assigned to me, I was eager to finish them because it felt so good to have accomplished work on time;;;;;;;
 I realized then that I was learning to be efficient at work;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job though was the quality of work that we do;;;;;;;
 We had a Quality Auditor that was very keen in her job, and was able to detect errors from our work everyday;;;;;;;
 We were not perfect but we were leading that way;;;;;;;
 Errors were part of the typical day at work that only wanted to show the areas of which we need some focus on;;;;;;;
 I realized then that I was learning to be effective at work;;;;;;;
 That way, we know how to improve our performances;;;;;;;
 Those performances had an equivalent points which were added to our individual metrics;;;;;;;
 the highest pointer will be recognized as the Most Valuable Processor;;;;;;;

I joined MS as a Vendor and there was no diffrence between my role and FTE role;;;;;;;
 I learnt how to deal with an enterprise enviroments, how to cooperate with high level management people and the most importantly how to deliver great results always on time;;;;;;;
,I have been very lucky to work with great, pasionate people;;;;;;;
I currently work for a small digital marketing company based in north Jersey;;;;;;;
 The pros about the job are that I cybercommute every day from my apt and i know the owner of the company on a personal level, so my interaction and communication with my boss is pleasant and typically business casual;;;;;;;
 The cons are the inconsistent hours that I am scheduled every week and the lack of benefits, perks, or opportunity for any advancement;;;;;;;
 I am eager to grow my career, rather than continue in the same cycle indefinitely;;;;;;;
 The work is relatively simple as i have a predilection for the job requirements, and I would welcome an opportunity in a similar field;;;;;;;
 To clarify, I am not displeased with my current employment in any way, I am simply searching for a way to advance my personal career;;;;;;;
Being in a company for quite a long time I will be really missing the team;;;;;;;
I had a great life experience on a daily basis and have learned to focus on my work in all situations;;;;;;;
 I had the best co-workers ever;;;;;;;
actively involved in team engagement and service delivery;;;;;;;
 Learned how to do exceptional client service and work life balancing;;;;;;;
I like the place as its gives a lot of scope for learning but its bad with work life balance;;;;;;;
A very diversified atmosphere with great people to work with;;;;;;;
Great organisation with very nice work culture;;;;;;;
 Employee respect is one of the great value;;;;;;;
 Flexibility for new moms to be and women ;;;;;;;
Deloitte - 5/5;;;;;;;
,I have learned and grown in Deloitte as it was my first job and I really loved my Job and all the people I worked with;;;;;;;
 Its just i want to do something in US so I flew from India;;;;;;;
,I was working for Deloitte India - Supporting CA office's;;;;;;;
 My Arena in Tax was Net High Worth Individuals and 501 (c) 3 Organizations,;;;;;;;
Very chilled, relaxed but yet productive working environment;;;;;;;
 Many opportunities are available for growth and development, management system is very complex which is expected for such a large company;;;;;;;
Fun place to work with all various types of people and different groups in one area;;;;;;;
 The work is straight forward and mostly vendor based projects;;;;;;;
Deloitte dos not provide good work life balance and the management is poor;;;;;;;
nothing i like this job and site for computer designer and photographic and capture;;;;;;;
Accenture  is a multinational management consulting, technology services, and outsourcing company;;;;;;;
 Its incorporated headquarters have been in Dublin, Ireland;;;;;;;
 Accenture is one of the TOP IT consulting concern with very good SAP practice and process;;;;;;;
Great benefits, mixed experience with people, poor mid-level management;;;;;;;
"  Networking and ""who you know"" more important that what you deliver and the quality of your work";;;;;;;
I have learned to be patient, open minded, and ready to take on a new day;;;;;;;
 The company is great, with plenty of opportunities available inside;;;;;;;
Here at Alstom we work as a team to complete job mission on a day to day bases;;;;;;;
 Here we build the inside of a high voltage meters that will go inside of a transformer;;;;;;;
Working at Microsoft has been amazing;;;;;;;
 The culture is in everything that we do;;;;;;;
 You really do end up loving the company once you join the team;;;;;;;
 ,In a retail environment I have seen several pears grow and get promoted to management positions and corporate positions;;;;;;;
It's a big company and had a lot of politics but as a woman working in technology, it was tough to work through the politics;;;;;;;
 We were always disregarded;;;;;;;
 Not considered for better roles;;;;;;;
 No freedom to choose projects;;;;;;;
easily learned and gained knowledge,good place and enjoyed at work;;;;;;;
A typical day started off with reviewing, sorting, and when needed - respond to over-night emails;;;;;;;
 In addition to team and company correspondence, they also consisted of automation test results and testing done over-seas;;;;;;;
 Next, I would review my bugs in the database to see what needed follow-up on for that day;;;;;;;
 In my last position, we would have a daily scrum to sync up with all our teammates on where we all were in our tasks and goals for the project;;;;;;;
 This is also where we would make agile decisions on our workforce and re-assign folks or create new tasks to help keep the project on track for its determined release date;;;;;;;
,Before working at Microsoft, I was a video editor and award winning 3D animator;;;;;;;
 However, I didn't know very much about software development - just how to manipulate it to get my work done;;;;;;;
 Working at Microsoft, I learned on the job about how to perform software testing - specifically manual UI;;;;;;;
 In addition, I picked up a lot of general information on the use of Microsoft products and devices;;;;;;;
 I also learned a lot about corporate networking;;;;;;;
 Because I served on many teams, I got to understand on a deep level the following products: My Sync II, Point of Sale OS, Hyper-V, Zune, IE, and CE OS and many portable devices over the years;;;;;;;
,Microsoft is a big company, so my experience won't represent the company so much as just a small part of it that I worked with;;;;;;;
 My managers were all great and very helpful;;;;;;;
 Because I started after the company had matured, the managers were very good about work/life expectations;;;;;;;
 That made it a very safe environment to work in;;;;;;;
Supervise all operational transactions such as transfers, deposits, withdrawal, checks deposit for collection;;;;;;;
Great place to start and great experience;;;;;;;
 High intensity projects, but 4 years at Accenture is worth 10 in industry in my opinion;;;;;;;
Great culture;;;;;;;
 Work days can be long with lots of travel;;;;;;;
 The internal education programs are evolving as the consulting practice is starting to find its own footing;;;;;;;
,Most of the people I work with are good and honest people who care about others and their work products;;;;;;;
 The leadership is still trying to define the firms niche in the consulting realm;;;;;;;
 As a result, consistency across the service lines varies by practice and partner, but the concept is evolving;;;;;;;
The work has become repetitive and monotonous over a period of time, thus resulting in boredom;;;;;;;
,I learned people and time management skills;;;;;;;
,There is no micro management and we work independently;;;;;;;
,Co-workers are very co-operative and supportive of one another;;;;;;;
,Hardest part is to manage time and budget;;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of the job is to solve customer problems satisfactory;;;;;;;
Good place to learn and start a career;;;;;;;
 Ideas and suggestions are encouraged;;;;;;;
 If organisation and job satisfaction is more important to you than salary, please join Accenture;;;;;;;
 You will not be disappointed;;;;;;;
The people that I worked with made the job bearable;;;;;;;
 If they paid more than they did I would be there right now, but there was no sign of that improving so I had to go;;;;;;;
Accenture provides good Employee benefits;;;;;;;
,Long working hours, uncertainity of location as soon as you are off a project Accenture policy says you have to relocate based on the next project's location, which makes it very difficult for professionals to have a settled life;;;;;;;
I can't say nothing negative about this company;;;;;;;
 They are awesome to work for and really care about their employees;;;;;;;
 If you are so lucky to work for them you should;;;;;;;
it was great time to work in Nissan automotive company and the management of the company were encouraging and friendly with the employee;;;;;;;
 and getting to learn many thing in the company as the staff were motivating and encouraging to the employee;;;;;;;

There are no typical days at EY;;;;;;;
 One any given day the assignments and work can and will vary;;;;;;;
 The firm places people first and it is integrated well into its corporate culture;;;;;;;
,The work environment provides opportunities to take leadership positions based on ability and accomplishments rather than seniority;;;;;;;
 My colleagues are driven, motivated and talented;;;;;;;
Very good workplace for people interested in the field of Consulting;;;;;;;
 But employees should be provided more training on tools to further their knowledge;;;;;;;
Nice company to work for but a bit imposing in terms of adapting to the culture of companies it merges with;;;;;;;
 It has a global reach and I appreciate the Google-like atmosphere it imposes, however, I find the adaptability a bit lacking or trying hard at best;;;;;;;
getting to know the job, and the company, as part as school work experiance;;;;;;;
I enjoy working in the organisation and people are having helping attitude which motivates to work better and boost individual performance;;;;;;;
It was the greatest work experience I have had to date;;;;;;;
 I was exploited for my skills and talents and laid off when the developers found a more cost effective way to do my job but that is business;;;;;;;

A lot is expected of Deloitte staff and the work can be very tiring, however, do you come home feeling like you have earned your money;;;;;;;
 ,Management, for the large part is great to work with, but with the high levels of work that they have, it can be difficult to get a hold of them when you need them;;;;;;;
 In saying that, it does force you to develop yourself quickly and teach yourself new skills due to the level of autonomy that you have;;;;;;;
,My co-workers are some of the most incredible people I have met and would be a great addition to any company that takes them on in the future;;;;;;;
,A worrying feature, is the amount of contract work in all departments and the high rate of turn over;;;;;;;
I believe EDF to be a good solid Company to work for as they have a very solid background in what they do;;;;;;;
,They are experiencing the typical growing pains of any Company that is new in Canada but they are a Large Company elsewhere;;;;;;;
,This is a Company to watch in the future;;;;;;;
My colleges are nice and we communicate really with each others;;;;;;;
 My boss is cool but is demanding;;;;;;;
,The most enjoyable part of the job is to meet people and talk with them about ethic, doing presentation and work to develop an ethic behavior in the company;;;;;;;
,The hardest part is to convince the employee, that ethic is important for the company;;;;;;;
 We work a lot on training the employees because they do not understand the meaning of ethic;;;;;;;
Challenge work, good relationship between peers, good training, good benefit;;;;;;;
 A lot overtime;;;;;;;

 Typically hours of work are pretty flexible, the co-workers are always hard working and hospitable;;;;;;;
 My day has always been varied in experience due to the nature of the projects I've been involved in;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of my job is always the viability of the work, too many times upper management reorganizes the team/division/department and projects are completely changed (to a less important task) or altogether ended;;;;;;;

 Not they cut corners on everything;;;;;;;
 A typical workday is very stressful with no praise, ever;;;;;;;
 I have learned a lot since I have been here, but I stopped learning new things after the first year;;;;;;;
 Management is inept and overpaid;;;;;;;
 Most of my coworkers are lazy, but I have made good friends and relationships while I have been at Deloitte;;;;;;;
" The hardest part of the job is to keep coming to work knowing that there is no chance for advancement in my current department; not matter how hard you work";;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job is going home;;;;;;;
Lack of creative culture, Lures you with benefits but sweatshop mentality once you're a full time employee;;;;;;;
 They have a tendency to promote character assassination to justify dismissal;;;;;;;
 This is and org that teaches that there must always be one employee that is not hitting targets;;;;;;;
 Its not about competencies its about Likability at the company;;;;;;;

 Your salary will grow exponentially;;;;;;;
Fast paced, entrenurial environment which helped with healthy competition both internally and externally;;;;;;;
,Deplomacy needed everyday;;;;;;;
There are many, many perks to working at Google;;;;;;;
" While they do an excellent job at keeping their employees and contractors healthy and happy, those perks can easily ""trap"" you at work";;;;;;;
 So you have to make sure you balance not just work and play but time at the office and at home;;;;;;;

A typical day at work involved arriving at my desk by 8:00 am to begin reviewing trade papers and other news services to learn about what was happening in markets that day;;;;;;;
 I worked on a trading floor and was a member of an eight-person trading desk;;;;;;;
 The trading floor is fast paced and intense and it was not uncommon to be switching between tasks several times a day;;;;;;;
 My manager's style was less involved, which I favored;;;;;;;
 My co-workers were excellent professionals that were very knowledgeable and always willing to lend a helpful hand;;;;;;;
 I'm sure they would describe me in the same way;;;;;;;
 The most difficult part of my position was attempting to communicate market nuances in the sector that I covered;;;;;;;
 One of the most valuable skills that I further developed was providing market analyses in formats that cross functional banking teams could digest;;;;;;;
 This required interaction with very senior banking staff members;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of my position was working within the trading floor environment;;;;;;;
 There was plenty of banter and camaraderie between my co-workers and I;;;;;;;
During busy season we had to work for 15hrs which was typical days for me , I have gained loads of knowledge with my present job , I have complete touch of financial statement now , my co - workers were too supportive , working for long hours was the hardest part of my job , work environment was awesome in my present firm which would pull me to work more harder;;;;;;;

"My experience at Google summed up in one word would be ""unforgettable""";;;;;;;
 The opportunity of working in such a successful, prestigious company was a real privilege;;;;;;;
 A typical work day involved waking up early, catching the morning shuttle, enjoying a nice ride to work with comfortable seats and wifi, after arriving at my destination I would quickly go to the cafe nearest to me and grab some breakfast and coffee, then head over to my desk to check emails, and start working on my production;;;;;;;
 My co-workers were always very friendly and outgoing;;;;;;;
 We would all interact about our job and share insight or give advice to one another on how to improve;;;;;;;
 I've learned how important it is to ask for feedback on work in order to improve as well as give something back to the team;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of my job was completing the production in a timely manner but my favorite part was when it was finally accomplished at the end of the week;;;;;;;
 Overall great place to work!;;;;;;;

I go to work on my shift schedule, sit down on my chair with 2 monitor in front of me;;;;;;;
I enjoy exceeding quotas,sometimes it,s only about a half of my shift but I already reach it;;;;;;;
I don't waste any single time even though I meet what my job requires me;;;;;;;
But I also balance my work;;;;;;;
The hardest part of the job is the shifting schedule but I learned to manage it;;;;;;;
I enjoy working in a team of dynamic people;;;;;;;
The channel what I work for, Axa Exclusiv, has a bad management;;;;;;;
 The company doesnÂ´t hear the employes;;;;;;;
 Too much changes of direction, goals, philosophy,;;;;;;;
Bad work environment;;;;;;;
 Too much burocracy;;;;;;;
Good Organisation to work with;;;;;;;
 Only issue is Night Shifts;;;;;;;
,Overall, a good company to work with if one is ready to work in night shifts;;;;;;;
Very long hours with no bonus;;;;;;;
 Most employees do not start their day until 10:30AM requiring everyone to stay in the office later;;;;;;;
I have held HR Executive and operational positions however no task is too menial for me â€“ people are my passion and that is where I apply my skills;;;;;;;

Allianz Global Assistance is an amazing company with an imbedded culture;;;;;;;
 The atmosphere is very welcoming and friendly overall;;;;;;;
,Typically, they shoot for the median market value when pricing a job, so expect a fair salary where the culture and benefits make up the difference;;;;;;;
 They allow fairly flexible work times for the majority of the company, however if you're looking at the call center you will be expected to adhere to a more structured work schedule by necessity;;;;;;;
,The (somewhat) new CEO is great;;;;;;;
 He walks around and makes a point to talk to anyone whenever he has time;;;;;;;
,Attire is casual, most people wear jeans everyday (including the CEO) and on casual Friday's you're allowed to wear shorts (within reason);;;;;;;
,The building they're housed in is really something else;;;;;;;
 Very bohemian-industrial, but very clean;;;;;;;
 The floors are named by different continents and the conference rooms are identified by country names within said continents;;;;;;;
No surprises when it comes to your typical consulting firm;;;;;;;
 Fair compensation and heavy workloads;;;;;;;
I joined this company 3 years back as an associate software engineer;;;;;;;

,After being trained in SAP in the domain of business intelligence, I went to work with some of the biggest companies in the world, who were our clients;;;;;;;

 These businesses received a month subscription for a free website from Google;;;;;;;
 I presented about ten different businesses information on what internet users preferred and trusted on web pages, and offered ideas about how to market and conduct their business online;;;;;;;
Overall, good compensation and work-life balance;;;;;;;
  It is in transformational stage, lots of uncertainties and negative stress at times;;;;;;;

Responsible for evaluating the accuracy of data, with specific task of identifying patterns in data and using judgment to take decisions on data quality;;;;;;;
,Working on tasks that are moderately complex in nature, comparing between multiple sources of information, with great attention to detail;;;;;;;
A reliable company to work for;;;;;;;
 Great experience to gain;;;;;;;
 Also a great way to connect with different experienced challenges;;;;;;;
Market pressure caused the firm to reduce headcount in the Financial Services Advisory practices;;;;;;;
" I had the highest utilization in my practice, but my unique skillset was difficult for them to deploy effectively in a ""go-forward"" mindset, despite high utilization in three of the past four years (go figure)";;;;;;;
 So I was let go, after almost twelve years, two months shy of a $20,000+ bonus and ONE WEEK PRIOR to the birth of my second child;;;;;;;
 There is an incredible opportunity to learn and grow at EY, but don't think for a second that they care about you as a person;;;;;;;
I have worked in Accenture for more than 4;;;;;;;
6 years and I would say it is a good company for freshers to work and learn;;;;;;;
,I have been working here as a QA analyst leading a team from Offshore;;;;;;;
 I would say the exposer you get with client teams is good, though recently it has been noticed that working environment is not being very good like it used to be;;;;;;;

Work closely with clients working on some of the complex operational strategy and design related question and operationalizing business strategies;;;;;;;
Good place to start a career, plenty of opportunities to explore and grow in;;;;;;;
 The concept of networking is great but proves to be a challenge for new joiners;;;;;;;
 The first year can be really tough;;;;;;;
At E&Y every day involved a different type of work and it was exciting to exposed to different projects and working with different people;;;;;;;
 I learned there a lot about working in a team and managing other accountants while working on large scale projects;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part of the job was the culture and having the chance to work with high level executives that are industry veterans and have great insights;;;;;;;

I loved this job and too bad it was only a one year contract;;;;;;;
 Typically a daily routine would be testing memory from the servers that google utilizes from all it's data centers globally;;;;;;;
 A few times a week we would brain storm over other IT related subjects and on Fridays we would go to lunch together and it felt more like a family atmosphere;;;;;;;
 I can honestly say I learned more about IT than in my 10 years working/school combined;;;;;;;
 Management was fair and respectable;;;;;;;
 Any time you needed personal time or was sick they would not hesitate to help out;;;;;;;
 Co workers were fun to work with and always there to assist in any issues I had or questions;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the job was the fast paced environment;;;;;;;
 We would continually receive shipments daily and had to inventory, scan and shelve the memory so if you ran a little behind it would be a challenge to catch up;;;;;;;
 But the overall job experience was great;;;;;;;
 It had all the perks that I heard about on the news, web, etc;;;;;;;
Its is good company , with decent work culture;;;;;;;
 Peers are helpful;;;;;;;
 helps to sponsor training for career enhancement;;;;;;;

 You have nice co-workers that take time to help you;;;;;;;
 I have learned to mange my work better and Organize;;;;;;;
 Improved on soft skills;;;;;;;
,SInce its a Huge MNC, I can only speak of the management of my project;;;;;;;
 They are work driven and dedicated to the client, but pay less attention to the employees;;;;;;;
 micro managing and your efforts are not recognized well;;;;;;;
,Overall I like it here, but i think its time to Move ahead with my career and look out for better oppurtinity;;;;;;;
nothing,,just like call center agent,,and how to make the customer satisfied;;;;;;;
It was a nice job, unfortunately it was on temporary;;;;;;;
 It was awesome working for Microsoft with the given Managers and Associates;;;;;;;
 We all worked hard together to get things done, and that was he best thing about working for this company;;;;;;;
 It was totally team work;;;;;;;

 The things I've learnt are many with the most important being the fact that I can work well under pressure, enhance my team spirit, be well organised and able to handle many different informations;;;;;;;
 The hardest part of the work of the auditor is the work life balance which unfortunately does not exist since the working hours are many, even during the weekends;;;;;;;
 The most enjoyable part is the fact that I had the opportunity to work with many different persons and learn something from each of them;;;;;;;
Really enjoyed my time with DX TED, as it was a fairly new org, with a ton of chaos and creativity happening;;;;;;;

5% of the available opportunities are genuinely interesting;;;;;;;
 On the technology side, this could mean actual software development (mostly very high end bespoke client work, or firm-funded rapid prototyping), and on the business side, it would generally mean strategy work;;;;;;;
 Most of these groups/teams only hire experienced candidates and perhaps a handful of really stellar junior people;;;;;;;
",The remaining 95% of the roles actually available to recent grads--the so called ""analysts""--are not nearly as glamorous as you think and you're almost certainly going to end up doing scut work";;;;;;;
"You aren't going to be designing city-spanning infrastructure or giving sought-after advice to C-suite executives; you're going to be doing systems integration (i";;;;;;;

,I also discussed technical issues with the audit partner, manager and other seniors;;;;;;;
 Also, We held meetings with the management of the Puerto Rico Treasury Department, to discuss our audit progress, technical issues and request follow up on the documents requested to the component units;;;;;;;

Is a good place to work, but hard at times to meet targets and shift timing is so difficult to be followed for a long time period;;;;;;;
 the work time is 10 hours which is too high and not usual;;;;;;;
Good place to work for starters and if you get attached to a good technology hen you will get a good chance to learn and work with global clients;;;;;;;
management is not good,they hold our salary's without any reasons ,they give alot of  pressure not understand us,out of source they give us the work ,they dont take any care for employer;;;;;;;
Deloitte in Cyprus is the ideal location to begin your ACA studies and professional life;;;;;;;
 The support and understanding from the whole company when it comes to the students is amazing: Study leaves, annual leaves, the college's programme, everything is oriented towards gaining this invaluable qualification;;;;;;;
,At work though, things are a bit weird;;;;;;;
 A recent move to new offices, with an open plan setup of work, way too many people on each floor and everything painted in grey, makes the worklplace dull, noisy and unwelcoming;;;;;;;
 Every step feels like you are being watched, there's no maintaining your identity in this uniformity of clean desks and suits, and the interpersonal contacts and relationships are restricted to the one hour lunch;;;;;;;
,It used to be that the people working here were the most valuable assets of the company, yet year by year a lack of motivation and enthusiasm is increased and becomes solidified within this building;;;;;;;
 I hope a change happens within the next few years regarding these matters, as this firm is a really good one and it would be a shame for its progress (the new offices) to kill its reputation;;;;;;;
Horrible work environment;;;;;;;
,No growth;;;;;;;
 No ethics,Cheap politics;;;;;;;

Great place to work, however not garunteed that you will keep your job for long;;;;;;;
 Sometimes you may see a bunch of people leaving and being fired, and wonder whats going on;;;;;;;
 The job is simple, the expectations are set well, however if you don't perform, consider your self on the line all the time;;;;;;;
It was a great opportunity to discover my potentials at Deloitte;;;;;;;
 The staff were all very cooperative and friendly;;;;;;;
 Proper guidance was always provided;;;;;;;
 Management was also very supportive;;;;;;;
Overall it was fun;;;;;;;
When you apply for a consulting company you have to be aware of the high amount of hours you are going to dedicate to your job;;;;;;;
 Most of the time it depends on the team you are working with;;;;;;;
 I was lucky because in my team we used to work just 10 hours per day, while I heard others working definetly more;;;;;;;
 But if you love what you do, it might be irrelevant;;;;;;;
 I was close to be hired (in one week), but I decided to change because of the project, boring and not challenging;;;;;;;
  As told before it depends on your team;;;;;;;
 Some are involved in very interesting projects, others not (my case);;;;;;;
 You can always ask for a reallocation;;;;;;;
